# Foreword

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 General

## 4.1 Relationship with other core specifications

The present document is a single-RAT specification for a SAN, covering
RF characteristics and minimum performance requirements. Conducted and
radiated core requirements are defined for the SAN architectures and SAN
types defined in clause 4.3.

The applicability of each requirement is described in clause 4.6.

## 4.2 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements

Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling
the test requirements specified in the conformance specification TS
38.181 \[3\].

The minimum requirements given in this specification make no allowance
for measurement uncertainty. The test specifications TS 38.181 \[3\]
define test tolerances. These test tolerances are individually
calculated for each test. The test tolerances are used to relax the
minimum requirements in this specification to create test requirements.
For some requirements, including regulatory requirements, the test
tolerance is set to zero.

The measurement results returned by the test system are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the shared risk principle.

The shared risk principle is defined in recommendation ITU‑R M.1545
\[4\].

## 4.3 Requirement reference points

### 4.3.1 SAN type 1-H

For *SAN type 1-H*, the requirements are defined for two points of
reference, signified by radiated requirements and conducted
requirements.

![](./38108/media/image4.png){width="5.2in"
height="2.169139326334208in"}

Figure 4.3.1-1: Radiated and conducted reference points for *SAN type
1-H*

Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA), where the
radiated interface is referred to as the *Radiated Interface Boundary*
(RIB). Radiated requirements are also referred to as OTA requirements.
The (spatial) characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are
detailed for each requirement.

Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of *TAB
connectors* at the *transceiver array boundary*, which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.

The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver
functionality receiving and transmitting modulated signal to ensure
radio links with users.

The satellite payload is composed by a transceiver unit array and a
composite antenna array. The transceiver unit array contains an
implementation specific number of transmitter units and an
implementation specific number of receiver units.

The composite antenna contains a radio distribution network (RDN) and an
antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network which distributes the
RF power generated by the transceiver unit array to the antenna array,
and/or distributes the radio signals collected by the antenna array to
the transceiver unit array, in an implementation specific way.

How a conducted requirement is applied to the *transceiver array
boundary* is detailed in the respective requirement clause.

### 4.3.2 SAN type 1-O

For *SAN type 1-O*, the radiated characteristics are defined over the
air (OTA), where the *operating band* specific radiated interface is
referred to as the *Radiated Interface Boundary* (RIB). Radiated
requirements are also referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial)
characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are detailed for
each requirement.

## 4.4 Satellite Access Node classes

The requirements in this specification apply to Satellite Access Node
unless otherwise stated. The associated deployment scenarios are exactly
the same for SAN with and without connectors.

For SAN *type 1-O* and SAN *type 1-H*, two SAN classes (LEO and GEO) are
defined in Table 4.4-1.

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements
set by local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances the regional
requirements apply, since this is defined by local or regional
regulation.

## 5.3 Satellite Access Node channel bandwidth

### 5.3.1 General

The *SAN channel bandwidth* supports a single RF carrier in the uplink
or downlink at the SAN. Different UE channel bandwidths may be supported
within the same spectrum for transmitting to and receiving from UEs
connected to the SAN. The placement of the UE channel bandwidth is
flexible but can only be completely within the *SAN channel bandwidth*.
The SAN shall be able to transmit to and/or receive from one or more UE
bandwidth parts that are smaller than or equal to the number of carrier
resource blocks on the RF carrier, in any part of the carrier resource
blocks.

The relationship between the channel bandwidth, the guard band and the
*transmission bandwidth configuration* is shown in figure 5.3.1-1.

![](./38108/media/image6.emf).

Figure 5.3.1-1: Definition of channel bandwidth and *transmission
bandwidth configuration* for one channel

### 5.3.2 Transmission bandwidth configuration

The *transmission bandwidth configuration* N~RB~ for each *SAN channel
bandwidth* and subcarrier spacing is specified in table 5.3.2.-1 for
FR1.

## 5.4 Channel arrangement

### 5.4.1 Channel spacing

#### 5.4.1.1 Channel spacing for adjacent carriers

The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the
size of the frequency block available and the *SAN channel bandwidths*.
The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent SAN carriers is defined
as following:

\- For SAN FR1 *operating bands* with 100 kHz channel raster,

Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2

where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the *SAN channel bandwidths*
of the two respective SAN carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted
depending on the channel raster to optimize performance in a particular
deployment scenario.

### 5.4.2 Channel raster

#### 5.4.2.1 NR-ARFCN and channel raster

The global frequency raster defines a set of *RF reference frequencies*
F~REF~. The *RF reference frequency* is used in signalling to identify
the position of RF channels, SS blocks and other elements. The global
frequency raster is defined for all frequencies from 0 to 100 GHz. The
granularity of the global frequency raster is ΔF~Global~.

*RF reference frequencies* are designated by an NR Absolute Radio
Frequency Channel Number (NR-ARFCN) in the range \[0...3279165\] on the
global frequency raster. The relation between the NR-ARFCN and the *RF
reference frequency* F~REF~ in MHz is given by the following equation,
where F~REF-Offs~ and N~Ref-Offs~ are given in table 5.4.2.1-1 and
N~REF~ is the NR-ARFCN.

F~REF~ = F~REF-Offs~ + ΔF~Global~ (N~REF~ -- N~REF-Offs~)

Table 5.4.2.1-1: NR-ARFCN parameters for the global frequency raster

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The *channel raster* defines a subset of *RF reference frequencies* that
can be used to identify the RF channel position in the uplink and
downlink. The *RF reference frequency* for an RF channel maps to a
resource element on the carrier. For each *operating band*, a subset of
frequencies from the global frequency raster are applicable for that
band and forms a channel raster with a granularity ΔF~Raster~, which may
be equal to or larger than ΔF~Global~.

The mapping between the *channel raster* and corresponding resource
element is given in clause 5.4.2.2. The applicable entries for each
*operating band* are defined in clause 5.4.2.3.

#### 5.4.2.2 Channel raster to resource element mapping

The mapping between the *RF reference frequency* on the channel raster
and the corresponding resource element is given in table 5.4.2.2-1 and
can be used to identify the RF channel position. The mapping depends on
the total number of RBs that are allocated in the channel and applies to
both UL and DL. The mapping must apply to at least one numerology
supported by the SAN.

#### 5.4.2.3 Channel raster entries for each *operating band*

The RF channel positions on the channel raster in each SAN *operating
band* are given through the applicable NR-ARFCN in table 5.4.2.3-1 for
FR1, using the channel raster to resource element mapping in clause
5.4.2.2.

For SAN *operating bands* with 100 kHz channel raster, ΔF~Raster~ = 20 ×
ΔF~Global~. In this case, every 20^th^ NR-ARFCN within the *operating
band* are applicable for the channel raster within the *operating band*
and the step size for the channel raster in table 5.4.2.3-1 is given as
\<20\>.

### 5.4.3 Synchronization raster

#### 5.4.3.1 Synchronization raster and numbering

The synchronization raster indicates the frequency positions of the
synchronization block that can be used by the UE for system acquisition
when explicit signalling of the synchronization block position is not
present.

A global synchronization raster is defined for all frequencies. The
frequency position of the SS block is defined as SS~REF~ with
corresponding number GSCN. The parameters defining the SS~REF~ and GSCN
for all the frequency ranges are in table 5.4.3.1-1.

The resource element corresponding to the SS block reference frequency
SS~REF~ is given in clause 5.4.3.2. The synchronization raster and the
subcarrier spacing of the synchronization block are defined separately
for each band.

## 6.4 Transmit ON/OFF power

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

## 6.5 Transmitted signal quality

### 6.5.1 Frequency error

#### 6.5.1.1 General

Frequency error is the measure of the difference between the actual SAN
transmit frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source shall be
used for RF frequency and data clock generation.

For *SAN type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.5.1.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-H*

The modulated carrier frequency of each carrier configured by the SAN
shall be accurate to within 0.05 ppm observed over 1 ms.

### 6.5.2 Modulation quality

#### 6.5.2.1 General

Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured
carrier signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be
expressed as Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). The Error Vector Magnitude is
a measure of the difference between the ideal symbols and the measured
symbols after the equalization. This difference is called the error
vector. Details about how the EVM is determined are specified in Annex
B.

For *SAN type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.5.2.2 Minimum Requirement for *SAN type 1-H*

The EVM levels of each carrier for different modulation schemes on PDSCH
outlined in table 6.5.2.2-1 shall be met using the frame structure
described in clause 6.5.2.3.

Table 6.5.2.2-1: EVM requirements for *SAN type 1-H* carrier

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Modulation scheme for PDSCH             Required EVM
  --------------------------------------- -------------------------------
  QPSK                                    17.5 %

  16QAM                                   12.5 %

  64QAM (NOTE)                            8 %

  NOTE: EVM requirement for 64QAM is      
  optional, subject to manufacturer       
  declaration.                            
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 6.5.2.3 EVM frame structure for measurement

EVM shall be evaluated for each carrier over all allocated resource
blocks and downlink subframes. Different modulation schemes listed in
table 6.5.2.2-1 shall be considered for rank 1.

For all bandwidths, the EVM measurement shall be performed for each
carrier over all allocated resource blocks and downlink subframes within
10 ms measurement periods. The boundaries of the EVM measurement periods
need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

### 6.5.3 Time alignment error 

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

## 6.6 Unwanted emissions

### 6.6.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions \[2\]. In ITU terminology, out of
band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the *SAN
channel bandwidth* resulting from the modulation process and
non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions.
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for the SAN transmitter is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
and out-of-band emissions (OOBE). There is in addition a requirement for
occupied bandwidth.

Table 6.6.1-1: void

For *SAN type 1-H* the unwanted emission requirements are applied to sum
of power over all *TAB connectors* for all the configurations supported
by the SAN, except for occupied bandwidth in subclause 6.6.2.

### 6.6.2 Occupied bandwidth

#### 6.6.2.1 General

The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted
are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also Recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[8\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The minimum requirement below may be applied regionally. There may also
be regional requirements to declare the occupied bandwidth according to
the definition in the present clause.

For SAN *type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-H*

The occupied bandwidth for each carrier shall be less than the *SAN
channel bandwidth*.

### 6.6.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio

#### 6.6.3.1 General

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

The requirements shall apply outside the *SAN RF Bandwidth* or *Radio
Bandwidth* whatever the type of transmitter considered (single carrier
or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the
manufacturer's specification.

#### 6.6.3.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-H*

The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal
(BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter
centred on the adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.

The ACLR shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.6.3.2-1/2.

### 6.6.4 Out-of-band emissions

#### 6.6.4.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, the out-of-band emission (OOBE) limits for SAN
in FR1 are defined from BW~SAN~ channel edge up to frequencies separated
from the BW~SAN~ channel edge by 200% of the necessary bandwidth.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's
specification.

*Basic limits* are specified in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the BW~SAN~ *channel edge* frequency and
the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f_offset is the separation between the *channel edge* frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- PSD~Channel~ \[dBm/4kHz\] represents the Power Spectral Density of
the channel(s) operating in BW~SAN~.

\- BW~SAN~ \[MHz\] is the considered SAN transponder bandwidth.

\- $\Delta_{Sat\_ Class}\lbrack dB\rbrack$ is the *SAN class parameter*
in dB identified to characterize different SAN classes.

6.6.4.2 Minimum requirements for *SAN type 1-H*

For SAN operating in Bands n256, n255, the requirements are specified in
table 6.6.4.2-1 for GEO and LEO class respectively, in line with Annex 5
of ITU recommendation SM.1541-6 \[9\].

The SAN out-of-band emissions(OOBE) requirements for GEO and LEO classes
are therefore defined as described in Table 6.6.4.2‑1 below.

### 6.6.5 Transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.6.5.1 General

The transmitter spurious emission limits shall apply from 30 MHz to the
fifth harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the DL operating band,
excluding the *SAN transponder bandwidth* BW~SAN~ and the frequency
range where the out-of-band emissions apply. For some *operating bands*,
the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with the
5^th^ harmonic limit of the downlink *operating band*, as specified in
ITU-R recommendation SM.329 \[2\].

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

#### 6.6.5.2 Minimum requirements for *SAN type 1-H*

##### 6.6.5.2.1 General transmitter spurious emissions requirements

The requirements in table 6.6.5.2.1-1 shall apply. The application of
those limits shall be the same as for out-of-band emissions in clause
6.6.4.

##### 6.6.5.2.2 Protection of the own Satellite Access Node receiver 

This requirement shall be applied for NR FDD operation in order to
prevent the receivers of the SAN being de-sensitized by emissions from
its own SAN transmitter. It is measured at the *TAB connector* for *SAN
type 1-H* for any type of SAN which has common or separate Tx/Rx *TAB
connectors*.

The spurious emission *basic limits* are provided in table 6.6.5.2.2-1.

Table 6.6.5.2.2-1: SAN spurious emissions *basic limits* for protection
of the SAN receiver

  F~UL,low~ -- F~UL,high~    -96 dBm               100 kHz

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### 6.6.5.2.3 Additional spurious emissions requirements

The additional spurious emissions requirement is not applicable for SAN.

##### 6.6.5.2.4 Co-location with other Satellite Access Nodes

The co-location requirement is not applicable for SAN.

## 6.7 Transmitter intermodulation

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

# 7 Conducted receiver characteristics

## 7.1 General

Conducted receiver characteristics are specified at the *TAB connector*
for *SAN type 1-H*, with full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating condition.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for conducted
receiver characteristics requirements in clause 7:

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- The requirements shall be met with the transmitter unit(s) ON.

\- Throughput requirements do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- When SAN is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

\- For ACS and blocking characteristics, the negative offsets of the
interfering signal apply relative to the lower *SAN RF Bandwidth* edge
or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block gap*, and the positive offsets
of the interfering signal apply relative to the upper *SAN RF Bandwidth*
edge or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block gap*.

NOTE: In normal operating condition the SAN is configured to transmit
and receive at the same time.

## 7.2 Reference sensitivity level 

### 7.2.1 General

The reference sensitivity power level P~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean
power received at the *TAB connector* for *SAN type 1-H* at which a
throughput requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel.

### 7.2.2 Minimum requirements for *SAN type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters specified
in table 7.2.2-1 and 7.2.2-2 for *SAN type 1-H* in all operating band in
FR1.

## 7.3 Dynamic range

### 7.3.1 General

The dynamic range is specified as a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering
signal at the *TAB connector* for *SAN type 1-H* inside the received SAN
channel bandwidth. In this condition, a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel. The interfering
signal for the dynamic range requirement is an AWGN signal.

### 7.3.2 Minimum requirements for *SAN type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters specified
in table 7.3.2-1 for LEO.

## 7.4 In-band selectivity and blocking

### 7.4.1 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)

#### 7.4.1.1 General

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency at
*TAB connector* for *SAN type 1-H* in the presence of an adjacent
channel signal with a specified center frequency offset of the
interfering signal to the band edge of a victim system.

#### 7.4.1.2 Minimum requirements for *SAN type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For SAN, the wanted and the interfering signal coupled to the *SAN type
1-H* *TAB connector* are specified in table 7.4.1.2-1 and the frequency
offset between the wanted and interfering signal in table 7.4.1.2-2 for
ACS. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in table 7.2.2-1 and 7.2.2-2 for each *SAN channel bandwidth*
in any operating band and further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
C.

The ACS requirement is applicable outside the *SAN RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *SAN RF Bandwidth* edges or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *TAB connector* for *SAN
type 1-H.*

### 7.4.2 In-band blocking

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

## 7.5 Out-of-band blocking

### 7.5.1 General

The out-of-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the *TAB
connector* for *SAN type 1-H* in the presence of an unwanted interferer
out of the *operating band*, which is a CW signal for out-of-band
blocking.

### 7.5.2 Minimum requirements for *SAN type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*SAN type 1-H* *TAB connector* using the parameters in table 7.5.2-1.

The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.2.2 for each *SAN channel bandwidth* and further specified in
annex A.1.

The out-of-band blocking requirement apply from 1 MHz to F~UL,low~ -
Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750 MHz, including the
downlink frequency range of the FDD *operating band* for SAN. The
Δf~OOB~ for *SAN type 1-H* is defined in table 7.5.2-2.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *TAB connector* for *SAN
type 1-H.*

## 7.6 Receiver spurious emissions

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

### 7.6.1 Void

### 7.6.2 Void

## 7.7 Receiver intermodulation

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

## 7.8 In-channel selectivity

### 7.8.1 General

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations at *TAB
connector* for *SAN type 1-H* in the presence of an interfering signal
received at a larger power spectral density. In this condition a
throughput requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel. The interfering signal shall be an NR signal which
is time aligned with the wanted signal.

### 7.8.2 Minimum requirements for *SAN type 1-H*

For *SAN type* *1-H*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in annex
A.1 with parameters specified in table 7.8.2-1 for GEO SAN, in table
7.8.2-2 for LEO SAN. The characteristics of the interfering signal is
further specified in annex C.

# 8 Conducted performance requirements

## 8.1 General

Conducted performance requirements specify the ability of the *SAN type
1-H* to correctly transmit and receive signals in various conditions and
configurations. Conducted performance requirements are specified at the
*TAB connector(s)* (for *SAN type 1-H*).

Conducted performance requirements for the SAN are specified for the
fixed reference channels defined in annex A and for the propagation
conditions defined in Recommendation ITU-R P.618 (*Propagation data and
prediction methods required for the design of Earth-space
telecommunication systems*).

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Performance requirements for a SAN supporting *carrier
aggregation* are defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

For FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall be met with the
transmitter units associated with *TAB connectors* (for *SAN type 1-H*)
in the *operating* *band* turned ON.

NOTE: In normal operating conditions, *TAB connectors* (for *SAN type
1-H*) in FDD operation are configured to transmit and receive at the
same time. The associated transmitter unit(s) may be OFF for some of the
tests as specified in TS 38.181 \[3\].

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

*S* is the total signal power in the slot on a single on a single *TAB
connector* (for *SAN type 1-H*).

*N* is the noise density integrated in a bandwidth corresponding to the
*transmission bandwidth* over the same duration where signal energy
exists on a single *TAB connector* (for *SAN type 1-H)*.

## 8.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH

### 8.2.1 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

#### 8.2.1.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

### 8.2.3 Requirements for UL timing adjustment

The performance requirement of UL timing adjustment is determined by a
minimum required throughput for the moving UE at given SNR. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

In the tests for UL timing adjustment, two signals are configured, one
being transmitted by a moving UE and the other being transmitted by a
stationary UE. The transmission of SRS from UE is optional. FRC
parameters in Table A.3-1 are applied for both UEs. The received power
for both UEs is the same. The resource blocks allocated for both UEs are
consecutive.

### 8.2.4 Requirements for PUSCH repetition Type A

#### 8.2.4.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a maximum block
error probability (BLER) for a given SNR. The BLER is defined as the
probability of incorrectly decoding the PUSCH information when the PUSCH
information is sent. The performance requirements assume HARQ
re-transmissions.

## 8.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH

### 8.3.1 DTX to ACK probability

#### 8.3.1.1 General

The DTX to ACK probability, i.e. the probability that ACK is detected
when nothing was sent:

$Prob(PUCCH\ DTX \rightarrow Ack\ bits) = \ \frac{\#(false\ ACK\ bits)}{\#(PUCCH\ DTX)*\#(ACK/NACK\ bits)}$

where:

\- #(false ACK bits) denotes the number of detected ACK bits.

\- #(ACK/NACK bits) denotes the number of encoded bits per slot

\- #(PUCCH DTX) denotes the number of DTX occasions

#### 8.3.1.2 Minimum requirement

The DTX to ACK probability shall not exceed 1% for all PUCCH formats
carrying ACK/NACK bits:

$Prob(PUCCH\ DTX \rightarrow Ack\ bits)\  \leq \ 10^{- 2}$

### 8.3.2 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 0

#### 8.3.2.1 General

The ACK missed detection probability is the probability of not detecting
an ACK when an ACK was sent.

### 8.3.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1

#### 8.3.3.1 NACK to ACK requirements

##### 8.3.3.1.1 General

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability that an ACK bit
is falsely detected when an NACK bit was sent on the particular bit
position, where the NACK to ACK detection probability is defined as
follows:

![](./38108/media/image12.wmf){width="4.173611111111111in"
height="0.3888888888888889in"},

where:

\- ![](./38108/media/image13.wmf){width="1.1805555555555556in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}denotes the total number of NACK bits
transmitted

\- ![](./38108/media/image14.wmf){width="2.048611111111111in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}denotes the number of NACK bits decoded
as ACK bits at the receiver, i.e. the number of received ACK bits

\- NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are
mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be
considered.

Random codeword selection is assumed.

### 8.3.7 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH

#### 8.3.7.1 General

#### 8.3.7.2 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH format 1

##### 8.3.7.2.1 NACK to ACK requirements

###### 8.3.7.2.1.1 General

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability that an ACK bit
is falsely detected when a NACK bit was sent on the particular bit
position, where the NACK to ACK detection probability is defined as
follows:

![](./38108/media/image12.wmf){width="4.173611111111111in"
height="0.3888888888888889in"},

where:

\- ![](./38108/media/image13.wmf){width="1.1805555555555556in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}denotes the total number of NACK bits
transmitted

\- ![](./38108/media/image14.wmf){width="2.048611111111111in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}denotes the number of NACK bits decoded
as ACK bits at the receiver, i.e., the number of received ACK bits

\- NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are
mapped from DTX, i.e., NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be
considered.

Random codeword selection is assumed.

## 8.4 Performance requirements for PRACH

### 8.4.1 PRACH False alarm probability

#### 8.4.1.1 General

The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas,
for any channel bandwidth.

The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of
erroneous detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any
detector) when input is only noise.

#### 8.4.1.2 Minimum requirement

The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.

### 8.4.2 PRACH detection requirements

#### 8.4.2.1 General

The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several
error cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent,
not detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with
the wrong timing estimation. For AWGN, NTN-TDLA100, a timing estimation
error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path
is larger than the time error tolerance given in Table 8.4.2.1-1.

# 9 Radiated transmitter characteristics

## 9.1 General

Radiated transmitter characteristics requirements apply on the *SAN type
1-H or* *SAN type 1-O* including all its functional components active
and for all foreseen modes of operation of the SAN unless otherwise
stated.

## 9.2 Radiated transmit power

### 9.2.1 General

*SAN type 1-H and SAN type 1-O* are declared to support one or more
beams, as per manufacturer\'s declarations specified in TS 38.181 \[3\].
Radiated transmit power is defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam
at a specific *beam peak direction*.

For each beam, the requirement is based on declaration of a beam
identity, *reference beam direction pair*, beamwidth, *rated beam EIRP*,
*OTA peak directions set*, the *beam direction pairs* at the maximum
steering directions and their associated *rated beam EIRP* and
beamwidth(s).

For a declared beam and *beam direction pair*, the *rated beam EIRP*
level is the maximum power that the SAN is declared to radiate at the
associated *beam peak direction* during the *transmitter ON period*.

For each *beam peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair*
within the *OTA peak directions set*, a specific *rated beam EIRP* level
may be claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy
requirement as described below. *Rated beam EIRP* is only required to be
declared for the *beam direction pairs* subject to conformance testing
as detailed in TS 38.181 \[3\].

NOTE 1: *OTA peak directions set* is set of *beam peak directions* for
which the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met. The *beam
peak directions* are related to a corresponding contiguous range or
discrete list of *beam centre directions* by the *beam direction pairs*
included in the set.

NOTE 2: A *beam direction pair* is data set consisting of the *beam
centre direction* and the related *beam peak direction.*

NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer
for verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the
manufacturer to the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment
and is not subject to formal conformance testing.

### 9.2.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-H* and *SAN type 1-O*

For each declared beam, in normal conditions, for any specific *beam
peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair* within the *OTA
peak directions set*, a manufacturer claimed EIRP level in the
corresponding *beam peak direction* shall be achievable to within ±2.2
dB of the claimed value.

Normal conditions are defined in TS 38.181, annex B \[3\].

In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may
apply also for some conditions outside the range of conditions defined
as normal.

## 9.3 OTA Satellite Access Node output power

### 9.3.1 General

OTA SAN output power is declared as the TRP radiated requirement, with
the output power accuracy requirement defined at the RIB. TRP does not
change with beamforming settings as long as the *beam peak direction* is
within the *OTA peak directions set*. Thus the TRP accuracy requirement
must be met for any beamforming setting for which the *beam peak
direction* is within the *OTA peak directions set*.

The SAN *rated carrier TRP output power* for *SAN type 1-O* shall be
based on manufacturer declaration.

Despite the general requirements for the SAN output power described in
clause 9.3.2, additional regional requirements might be applicable.

### 9.3.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

In normal conditions, the *SAN type 1-O* *maximum carrier TRP output
power*, P~max,c~,~TRP~ measured at the RIB shall remain within ±2 dB of
the *rated carrier TRP output power* P~rated,c,TRP~, as declared by the
manufacturer.

Normal conditions are defined in TS 38.181 \[3\], annex B.

## 9.4 OTA output power dynamics

### 9.4.1 General

Transmit signal quality (as specified in clause 9.6) shall be maintained
for the output power dynamics requirements.

The OTA output power requirements are *directional requirements* and
apply to the *beam peak directions* over the *OTA peak directions set*.

### 9.4.2 OTA RE power control dynamic range

#### 9.4.2.1 General

The OTA RE power control dynamic range is the difference between the
power of an RE and the average RE power for a SAN at maximum output
power (P~max,c,EIRP~) for a specified reference condition.

This requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
*operating band*.

#### 9.4.2.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

The OTA RE power control dynamic range is specified the same as the
conducted RE power control dynamic range requirement for *SAN type 1-H*
in table 6.3.2.2-1.

### 9.4.3 OTA total power dynamic range

#### 9.4.3.1 General

The OTA total power dynamic range is the difference between the maximum
and the minimum transmit power of an OFDM symbol for a specified
reference condition.

This requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
*operating band*.

NOTE 1: The upper limit of the OTA total power dynamic range is the SAN
maximum carrier EIRP (P~max,c,EIRP~) when transmitting on all RBs. The
lower limit of the OTA total power dynamic range is the average EIRP for
single RB transmission in the same direction using the same beam. The
OFDM symbol carries PDSCH and not contain RS or SSB.

#### 9.4.3.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

OTA total power dynamic range minimum requirement for SAN type 1-O is
specified such as for each NR carrier it shall be larger than or equal
to the levels specified for the conducted requirement for SAN type 1-H
in table 6.3.3.2-1.

## 9.5 OTA transmit ON/OFF power

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

## 9.6 OTA transmitted signal quality

### 9.6.1 OTA frequency error

#### 9.6.1.1 General

OTA frequency error is the measure of the difference between the actual
SAN transmit frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source shall
be used for RF frequency and data clock generation.

OTA frequency error requirement is defined as a *directional
requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage
range*.

#### 9.6.1.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

The modulated carrier frequency of each carrier configured by the SAN
shall be accurate to within 0.05 ppm observed over 1 ms.

### 9.6.2 OTA modulation quality

#### 9.6.2.1 General

Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured
carrier signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be
expressed as Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). Details about how the EVM is
determined are specified in annex B for FR1.

OTA modulation quality requirement is defined as a *directional
requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage
range*.

#### 9.6.2.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

For *SAN type 1-O*, the EVM levels of each carrier for different
modulation schemes on PDSCH outlined in table 6.5.2.2-1 shall be met.
Requirements shall be the same as clause 6.5.2.2 and follow EVM frame
structure from clause 6.5.2.3.

### 9.6.3 OTA time alignment error

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

## 9.7 OTA unwanted emissions

### 9.7.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and
spurious emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 \[2\]. In
ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the *SAN channel bandwidth* resulting from the
modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding
spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products,
but exclude out of band emissions.

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the *SAN type 1-O* is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
and out-of-band emissions.(OOBE). The unwanted emission requirements are
applied per cell for all the configurations. Requirements for OTA
unwanted emissions are captured as TRP requirements or *directional
requirements*, as described per requirement.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.

### 9.7.2 OTA occupied bandwidth

#### 9.7.2.1 General

The OTA occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that,
below the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers
emitted are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[8\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The minimum requirement below may be applied regionally. There may also
be regional requirements to declare the OTA occupied bandwidth according
to the definition in the present clause.

The OTA occupied bandwidth is defined as a *directional requirement* and
shall be met in the manufacturer\'s declared *OTA coverage range* at the
RIB.

#### 9.7.2.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

The OTA occupied bandwidth for each carrier shall be less than the *SAN
channel bandwidth*.

### 9.7.3 OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 9.7.3.1 General

OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The
measured power is TRP.

The requirement shall be applied per RIB.

#### 9.7.3.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

The ACLR limit specified in tables 6.6.3.2-1 for SAN GEO class and
6.6.3.2-2 for SAN LEO class shall apply.

For a RIB operating in multi-carrier, the ACLR requirements in clause
6.6.3.2 shall apply to SAN channel bandwidths of the outermost carrier
for the frequency ranges defined in tables 6.6.3.2-1 and 6.6.3.2-2.

### 9.7.4 OTA out-of-band emissions

#### 9.7.4.1 General

The OTA limits for out-of-band emissions are specified as TRP per RIB
unless otherwise stated.

#### 9.7.4.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

Out-of-band emissions in FR1 are limited by OTA out-of-band emission
limits. Unless otherwise stated, the out-of-band emission limits in FR1
are defined from channel edge up to frequencies separated from the
channel edge by 200% of the necessary bandwidth. The requirements shall
apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and for all
transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification. For a
RIB operating in multi-carrier, the requirements apply to SAN channel
bandwidths of the outermost carrier for the frequency ranges defined in
clause 6.6.4.1.

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for SAN type 1-O shall not
exceed each applicable limit in clause 6.6.4.2.

### 9.7.5 OTA transmitter spurious emissions

#### 9.7.5.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.

The OTA spurious emissions limits are specified as TRP per RIB unless
otherwise stated.

#### 9.7.5.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

##### 9.7.5.2.1 General

The OTA transmitter spurious emission limits for FR1 shall apply from
30 MHz to the 5^th^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the DL
operating band, excluding the *SAN transponder bandwidth* BW~SAN~ and
the frequency range where the out-of-band emissions apply.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

##### 9.7.5.2.2 General OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

The *basic limits* of table 9.7.5.2.2-1 shall apply. The application of
those limits shall be the same as for operating band unwanted emissions
in clause 6.6.4.

##### 9.7.5.2.3 Protection of the SAN receiver 

The co-location requirement is not applicable for SAN in this version of
the specification.

##### 9.7.5.2.4 Additional spurious emissions requirements

The additional spurious emissions requirement is not applicable for SAN.

## 9.8 OTA transmitter intermodulation

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

# 10 Radiated receiver characteristics

## 10.1 General

Radiated receiver characteristics are specified at RIB for *SAN type 1-H
or* *SAN type 1-O*, with full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating condition.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for the
radiated receiver characteristics requirements in clause 10:

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- The requirements shall be met with the transmitter unit(s) ON.

\- Throughput requirements defined for the radiated receiver
characteristics do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- When SAN is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

\- For ACS and blocking characteristics, the negative offsets of the
interfering signal apply relative to the lower *SAN RF Bandwidth* edge,
and the positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the
upper *SAN RF Bandwidth* edge.

\- Each requirement shall be met over the RoAoA specified.

NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the SAN in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time.

For FR1 requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*
absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10\*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) dB
for the reference direction

and

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10\*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) dB
for all other directions

For requirements which are to be met over the *minSENS RoAoA* absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)

## 10.2 OTA sensitivity

#### 10.2.1 General

The OTA sensitivity requirement is a *directional requirement* based
upon the declaration of one or more *OTA sensitivity direction
declarations* (OSDD), related to a *SAN type 1-H* and *SAN type 1-O*
receiver.

The *SAN type 1-H* and *SAN type 1-O* may optionally be capable of
redirecting/changing the *receiver target* by means of adjusting SAN
settings resulting in multiple *sensitivity RoAoA*. The *sensitivity
RoAoA* resulting from the current SAN settings is the active
*sensitivity RoAoA*.

If the SAN is capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related to
the OSDD then the OSDD shall include:

\- *SAN channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS level applicable to
any active *sensitivity RoAoA* inside the *receiver target redirection
range* in the OSDD.

\- A declared *receiver target redirection range*, describing all the
angles of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative
settings in the SAN.

\- Five declared *sensitivity RoAoA* comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in TS 38.181 \[3\].

\- The *receiver target reference direction*.

NOTE 1: Some of the declared *sensitivity RoAoA* may coincide depending
on the redirection capability.

NOTE 2: In addition to the declared *sensitivity RoAoA*, several
*sensitivity RoAoA* may be implicitly defined by the *receiver target
redirection range* without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.

If the SAN is not capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related
to the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:

\- The set(s) of RAT, *SAN channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS
level applicable to the *sensitivity RoAoA* in the OSDD.

\- One declared active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

\- The *receiver target reference direction*.

NOTE 3: For SAN without target redirection capability, the declared
(fixed) *sensitivity RoAoA* is always the active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.2.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the
active *sensitivity RoAoA* of an OSDD, the error rate criterion as
described in clause 7.2 shall be met when the level of the arriving
signal is equal to the minimum EIS level in the respective declared set
of EIS level and *SAN channel bandwidth*.

## 10.3 OTA reference sensitivity level

### 10.3.1 General

The OTA REFSENS requirement is a *directional requirement* and is
intended to ensure the minimum OTA reference sensitivity level for a
declared *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*. The OTA reference sensitivity power level
EIS~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean power received at the RIB at which a
reference performance requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel.

The OTA REFSENS requirement shall apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.3.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in the corresponding table and annex
A.1 when the OTA test signal is at the corresponding EIS~REFSENS~ level
and arrives from any direction within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

## 10.4 OTA dynamic range

## 10.4.1 General

The OTA dynamic range is a measure of the capability of the receiver
unit to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering signal
inside the received *SAN channel bandwidth*.

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.4.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters specified
in table 10.4.2-1 for LEO SAN.

## 10.5 OTA in-band selectivity and blocking

### 10.5.1 OTA adjacent channel selectivity

#### 10.5.1.1 General

OTA Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive an OTA wanted signal at its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of an OTA adjacent channel signal with a
specified centre frequency offset of the interfering signal to the band
edge of a victim system.

#### 10.5.1.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR1, the OTA wanted signal and the interfering signal are specified
in table 10.5.1.2-1 and table 10.5.1.2-2 for OTA ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is further specified in
annex A.1. The characteristic of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex C.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the *SAN RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The OTA interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the *SAN RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio Bandwidth edges*.

### 10.5.2 OTA in-band blocking

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

## 10.6 OTA out-of-band blocking

### 10.6.1 General

The OTA out-of-band blocking characteristics are a measure of the
receiver unit ability to receive a wanted signal at the *RIB* at its
assigned channel in the presence of an unwanted interferer.

### 10.6.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

#### 10.6.2.1 General minimum requirement

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted signal applies to each supported polarization, under the
assumption of *polarization match.* The interferer shall be
*polarization matched* in-band and the polarization maintained for
out-of-band frequencies.

For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signals provided at the RIB using the
parameters in table 10.6.2.1-1, the following requirements shall be met:

\- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the
OTA wanted signal is identified in clause 10.3.2 for each *SAN channel
bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1.

For *SAN type 1-O* the OTA out-of-band blocking requirement apply from
30 MHz to F~UL,low~ - Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750
MHz, including the downlink frequency range of the SAN *operating band*.
The Δf~OOB~ for *SAN type 1-O* is defined in table 10.6.2.1-2.

## 10.7 OTA receiver spurious emissions

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

### 10.7.1 Void

### 10.7.2 Void

## 10.8 OTA receiver intermodulation

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

## 10.9 OTA in-channel selectivity

### 10.9.1 General

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations in the
presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power spectral
density. In this condition a throughput requirement shall be met for a
specified reference measurement channel. The interfering signal shall be
an NR signal as specified in annex A.1 and shall be time aligned with
the wanted signal.

### 10.9.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are the same direction
and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals applies to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match.*

For a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to the RIB, the following
requirements shall be met:

\- For *SAN type 1-O*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in annex
A.1 with parameters specified in table 10.9.2-1 for GEO SAN, in table
10.9.2-2 for LEO SAN. The characteristics of the interfering signal is
further specified in annex C.

# 11 Radiated performance requirements

## 11.1 General

### 11.1.1 Scope and definitions

Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the *SAN type
1-O* to correctly transmit and receive radiated signals in various
conditions and configurations. Radiated performance requirements are
specified at the RIB.

Radiated performance requirements for the SAN are specified for the
fixed reference channels defined inannex A and for the propagation
conditions defined in Recommendation ITU-R P.618 (*Propagation data and
prediction methods required for the design of Earth-space
telecommunication systems*). The requirements only apply to those FRCs
that are supported by the SAN.

The radiated performance requirements for *SAN type 1-O* are limited to
two OTA *demodulation branches* as described in clause 11.1.2.
Conformance requirements can only be tested for 1 or 2 *demodulation
branches* depending on the number of polarizations supported by the SAN,
with the required SNR applied separately per polarization.

Unless stated otherwise, radiated performance requirements apply for a
single carrier only. Radiated performance requirements for a SAN
supporting carrier aggregation are defined in terms of single carrier
requirements.

For *SAN type 1-O* in FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall
be met with the transmitter units associated with the RIB in the
*operating* *band* turned ON.

NOTE 1: *SAN type 1-O* in normal operating conditions in FDD operation
is configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The transmitter
unit(s) associated with the RIB may be OFF for some of the tests as
specified in TS 38.181\[3\].

In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may
be provided from the SAN to the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.

Whenever the \"RX antennas\" term is used for the radiated performance
requirements description, it shall refer to the *demodulation branches*
(i.e. not physical antennas of the antenna array).

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

*S* is the total signal power in a slot on a RIB.

*N* is the noise density integrated in a bandwidth corresponding to the
*transmission bandwidth* over the duration where signal energy exists on
a RIB.

### 11.1.2 OTA demodulation branches

Radiated performance requirements are only specified for up to 2
*demodulation branches*.

If the *SAN type 1-O* uses polarization diversity and has the ability to
maintain isolation between the signals for each of the *demodulation
branches*, then radiated performance requirements can be tested for up
to two *demodulation branches* (i.e. 1RX or 2RX test setups). When
tested for two *demodulation branches*, each demodulation branch maps to
one polarization.

If the *SAN type 1-O* does not use polarization diversity then radiated
performance requirements can only be tested for a single *demodulation
branch* (i.e. 1RX test setup).

######## Annex B (normative): Error Vector Magnitude (FR1)

# B.1 Reference point for measurement

The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a zero-forcing
(ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted in figure B.1-1 below.

![](./38108/media/image16.emf)

Figure B.1-1: Reference point for EVM measurement

# B.2 Basic unit of measurement

The basic unit of EVM measurement is defined over one slot in the time
domain and ![](./38108/media/image17.wmf) subcarriers in the frequency
domain:

![](./38108/media/image18.wmf)

where

*T* is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
active within the slot,

![](./38108/media/image19.wmf)is the set of subcarriers within the
![](./38108/media/image20.wmf) subcarriers with the considered
modulation scheme being active in symbol *t*,

![](./38108/media/image21.wmf) is the ideal signal reconstructed by the
measurement equipment in accordance with relevant Tx models,

![](./38108/media/image22.wmf) is the modified signal under test defined
in annex B.3.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the impact of
noise in the reference signals. The boundaries of the 10 ms measurement
intervals need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

# B.3 Modified signal under test

Implicit in the definition of EVM is an assumption that the receiver is
able to compensate a number of transmitter impairments. The signal under
test is equalized and decoded according to:

![](./38108/media/image23.wmf)

where

![](./38108/media/image24.wmf) is the time domain samples of the signal
under test.

![](./38108/media/image25.wmf) is the sample timing difference between
the FFT processing window in relation to nominal timing of the ideal
signal. Note that two timing offsets are determined, the corresponding
EVM is measured and the maximum used as described in annex B.7.

![](./38108/media/image26.wmf) is the RF frequency offset.

![](./38108/media/image27.wmf) is the phase response of the TX chain.

![](./38108/media/image28.wmf) is the amplitude response of the TX
chain.

# B.4 Estimation of frequency offset

The observation period for determining the frequency offset
![](./38108/media/image26.wmf) shall be 1 slot.

# B.5 Estimation of time offset

## B.5.1 General

The observation period for determining the sample timing difference
![](./38108/media/image25.wmf)shall be 1 slot.

In the following ![](./38108/media/image29.wmf) represents the middle
sample of the EVM window of length *W* (defined in annex B.5.2) or the
last sample of the first window half if *W* is even.

![](./38108/media/image29.wmf)is estimated so that the EVM window of
length *W* is centred on the measured cyclic prefix of the considered
OFDM symbol. To minimize the estimation error the timing shall be based
on demodulation reference signals. To limit time distortion of any
transmit filter the reference signals in the 1 outer RBs are not taken
into account in the timing estimation

Two values for ![](./38108/media/image30.wmf) are determined:

![](./38108/media/image31.wmf) and

![](./38108/media/image32.wmf) where ![](./38108/media/image33.wmf) if
*W* is odd and ![](./38108/media/image34.wmf) if *W* is even.

When the cyclic prefix length varies from symbol to symbol then *T*
shall be further restricted to the subset of symbols with the considered
modulation scheme being active and with the considered cyclic prefix
length type.

## B.5.2 Window length

Table B.5.2-1, B.5.2-2, B.5.2-3 specify the EVM window length (*W*) for
normal CP.

# B.6 Estimation of TX chain amplitude and frequency response parameters

The equalizer coefficients

height="0.2152777777777778in"}and
![](./38108/media/image36.wmf){width="0.4097222222222222in"
height="0.2152777777777778in"} are determined as follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal
![](./38108/media/image37.wmf){width="0.5555555555555556in"
height="0.2152777777777778in"} and the post-FFT ideal signal
![](./38108/media/image38.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"}, for each reference signal, over 10ms
measurement interval. This process creates a set of complex ratios:

![](./38108/media/image39.wmf){width="1.7708333333333333in"
height="0.4583333333333333in"}

Where the post-FFT ideal signal
![](./38108/media/image38.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"} is constructed by the measuring
equipment according to the relevant TX specifications, using the
following parameters: i.e. nominal demodulation reference signals, (all
other modulation symbols are set to 0 V), nominal carrier frequency,
nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier, nominal
timing.

2\. Perform time averaging at each reference signal subcarrier of the
complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10ms measurement interval.
Prior to the averaging of the phases
![](./38108/media/image40.wmf){width="0.5347222222222222in"
height="0.25in"} an unwrap operation must be performed according to the
following definition: The unwrap operation corrects the radian phase
angles of ![](./38108/media/image41.wmf){width="0.5347222222222222in"
height="0.25in"} by adding multiples of 2\*PI when absolute phase jumps
between consecutive time instances t~i~ are greater than or equal to the
jump tolerance of PI radians. This process creates an average amplitude
and phase for each reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every second
subcarrier).

![](./38108/media/image42.wmf){width="1.2986111111111112in"

Where *N* is the number of reference signal; time-domain locations
*t~i~* from $Z'(t,f)$ for each reference signal subcarrier

height="0.2152777777777778in"}.

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase
![](./38108/media/image45.wmf){width="0.375in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"} and
![](./38108/media/image46.wmf){width="0.3819444444444444in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"} at the reference signal subcarriers are
obtained by computing the moving average in the frequency domain of the
time-averaged reference signal subcarriers, i.e. every second
subcarrier. The moving average window size is 19 and averaging is over
the DM-RS subcarriers in the allocated RBs. For DM-RS subcarriers at or
near the edge of the channel , or when the number of available DM-RS
subcarriers within a set of contiguously allocated RBs is smaller than
the moving average window size, the window size is reduced accordingly
as per figure B.6-1.

4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients
![](./38108/media/image45.wmf){width="0.375in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"} and
![](./38108/media/image46.wmf){width="0.3819444444444444in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"} to compute coefficients

# B.7 Averaged EVM

EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
$N_{dl}$ slots where $N_{dl}$ is the number of slots in a 10 ms
measurement interval.

For FDD the averaging in the time domain equals the $N_{dl}$ slot
duration of the 10 ms measurement interval from the equalizer estimation
step.

![](./38108/media/image50.wmf){width="2.2847222222222223in"
height="0.7777777777777778in"}

\- Where *Ni* is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

\- The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS
average at the window *W* extremities of the EVM measurements:

\- Thus ![](./38108/media/image51.wmf){width="0.7152777777777778in"
height="0.25in"} is calculated using
![](./38108/media/image52.wmf){width="0.625in" height="0.25in"}in the
expressions above and
![](./38108/media/image53.wmf){width="0.7569444444444444in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} is calculated using
![](./38108/media/image54.wmf){width="0.625in" height="0.25in"} in the
![](./38108/media/image55.wmf){width="0.6805555555555556in"
height="0.2916666666666667in"} calculation.

\- Thus we get:

$$\overline{EVM} = \max\left( {\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$$

######## Annex C (normative): Characteristics of the interfering signals

The interfering signal shall be a PUSCH or PDSCH containing data and
DM-RS symbols. Normal cyclic prefix is used. The data content shall be
uncorrelated to the wanted signal and modulated according to clause 6 of
TS 38.211 \[9\]. Mapping of PUSCH or PDSCH modulation to receiver
requirement are specified in table C-1.

######## Annex D (Normative): Propagation conditions

# D.1 Static propagation condition

The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist
for this propagation model.

# D.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions

The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:

\- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized
by a number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile
can be further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum
delay spanned by the taps.

\- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay
profile and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical
spectrum shape and a maximum Doppler frequency.

## D.2.1 Delay profiles

The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.811 \[13\] TDL models.
The simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps
are only used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay
profiles specified in G.2.1.1 can be used as such.

> \- Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.811 \[13\].
>
> \- Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays
>
> \- Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described
> in clause 7.7.2 in TR 38.901 \[12\].

\- Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is
done simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the
delay resolution.

\- Step 5: If multiple Rayleigh taps are rounded to the same delay bin,
merge them by calculating their linear power sum.

\- Step 6: If there is a LOS path in the model, the power for all paths
could be slightly adjusted to keep the RMS delay spread is close to
target delay spread and mean power is 0dB.

\- Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB
-8.8 dB)

\- Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap
merge, adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the
power of the last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.

\- Step 9: Re-normalize the highest Rayleigh tap to 0 dB when there is
no LOS path in the model.

Note 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification
steps may differ from the values in tables G.2.1.1-2 and G.2.1.1-3 for
the corresponding model.

Note 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the
linear domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the
linear domain.

### D.2.1.1 Delay profiles for FR1

The delay profiles for FR1 are selected to be representative of low,
medium and high delay spread environment. The resulting model parameters
are specified in table D.2.1.1-1 and the tapped delay line models are
specified in tables D.2.1.1-2 \~ D.2.1.1-4.

## D.2.2 Combinations of channel model parameters

The propagation conditions used for the performance measurements in
multi-path fading environment are indicated as a combination of a
channel model name and a maximum Doppler frequency, i.e.,
NTN-TDLA\<DS\>-\<Doppler\> or NTN-TDLC\<DS\>-\<Doppler\> where
\'\<DS\>\' indicates the desired delay spread and \'\<Doppler\>\'
indicates the maximum Doppler frequency (Hz).

## D.2.3 MIMO channel correlation matrices

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex D.2.3 apply for
the antenna configuration using uniform linear arrays at both SAN and UE
and for the antenna configuration using cross polarized antennas.

### D.2.3.1 MIMO correlation matrices using Uniform Linear Array

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex D.2.3.1 apply for
the antenna configuration using uniform linear array (ULA) at both SAN
and UE.

#### D.2.3.1.1 Definition of MIMO correlation matrices

Table D.2.3.1.1-1 defines the correlation matrix for the SAN.

               height="0.5041666666666667in"}
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table D.2.3.1.1-2 defines the correlation matrix for the UE:

Table D.2.3.1.1-3 defines the channel spatial correlation

height="0.2916666666666667in"}. The parameters, *α* and *β* in table
D.2.3.1.1-3 defines the spatial correlation between the antennas at the
SAN and UE respectively.

Table D.2.3.1.1-3:

                \alpha^{*} & 1
                \end{bmatrix}$$

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

For cases with more antennas at either SAN or UE or both, the channel
spatial correlation matrix can still be expressed as the Kronecker
product of $R_{UE}$ and $R_{SAN}\ $according to
${R_{spat} = \ R_{UE} \otimes R}_{SAN}$.

#### D.2.3.1.2 MIMO correlation matrices at high, medium and low level

D.2.3.1.2-1.

height="0.2222222222222222in"} identity matrix.

NOTE: For completeness, the correlation matrices were defined for high,
medium and low correlation but performance requirements exist only for
low correlation.

D.3 Moving propagation conditions

Figure D.3-1 illustrates the moving propagation conditions for the test
of the UL timing adjustment performance. The time difference between the
reference timing and the first tap is according Equation (D.3-1). The
timing difference between moving UE and stationary UE is equal to Δτ -
(*T~A~* −31)×16×64*T~c~* for 15kHz SCS, Δτ - (*T~A~* −31)×16×32*T~c~*
for 30kHz SCS and Δτ - (*T~A~* −31)×16×8*T~c~* for 120kHz SCS. The
relative timing among all taps is fixed. The parameters for the moving
propagation conditions are shown in Table D.3-1.
