#  Foreword

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

#  1 Scope

The present document establishes the minimum RF characteristics and
minimum performance requirements of NR and NB-IoT operation in NR
in-band Base Station (BS).

# 2 References

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

#  4 General

## 4.1 Relationship with other core specifications

The present document is a single-RAT specification for a BS, covering RF
characteristics and minimum performance requirements. Conducted and
radiated core requirements are defined for the BS architectures and BS
types defined in clause 4.3.

The applicability of each requirement is described in clause 5.

## 4.2 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements

Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling
the test requirements specified in the conformance specification TS
38.141-1 \[5\] and TS 38.141-2 \[6\].

The minimum requirements given in this specification make no allowance
for measurement uncertainty. The test specifications TS 38.141-1 \[5\]
and TS 38.141-2 \[6\] define test tolerances. These test tolerances are
individually calculated for each test. The test tolerances are used to
relax the minimum requirements in this specification to create test
requirements. For some requirements, including regulatory requirements,
the test tolerance is set to zero.

The measurement results returned by the test system are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the shared risk principle.

The shared risk principle is defined in recommendation ITU‑R M.1545
\[7\].

complement of transceivers for the configuration in normal operating
conditions. If any external apparatus such as an amplifier, a filter or
the combination of such devices is used, requirements apply at the far
end *antenna connector* (port B).

### 4.3.2 *BS type 1-H*

For *BS type 1-H*, the requirements are defined for two points of
reference, signified by radiated requirements and conducted
requirements.

![](./38104/media/image6.emf)

Figure 4.3.2-1: Radiated and conducted reference points for *BS type
1-H*

Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA), where the
*operating band* specific radiated interface is referred to as the
*Radiated Interface Boundary* (RIB). Radiated requirements are also
referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial) characteristics in which
the OTA requirements apply are detailed for each requirement.

Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of *TAB
connectors* at the *transceiver array boundary*, which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.

The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver
functionality generating modulated transmit signal structures and
performing receiver combining and demodulation.

The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific number of
transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver
units. Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into
transceiver units. The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to
transmit/receive parallel independent modulated symbol streams.

The composite antenna contains a radio distribution network (RDN) and an
antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network which distributes the
RF power generated by the transceiver unit array to the antenna array,
and/or distributes the radio signals collected by the antenna array to
the transceiver unit array, in an implementation specific way.

How a conducted requirement is applied to the *transceiver array
boundary* is detailed in the respective requirement clause.

### 4.3.3 *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O*

For *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O*, the radiated characteristics are
defined over the air (OTA), where the *operating band* specific radiated
interface is referred to as the *Radiated Interface Boundary* (RIB).
Radiated requirements are also referred to as OTA requirements. The
(spatial) characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are
detailed for each requirement.

![](./38104/media/image7.emf)

Figure 4.3.3-1: Radiated reference points for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type
2-O*

Co-location requirements are specified at the conducted interface of the
*co-location reference antenna*, the c*o-location reference antenna*
does not form part of the BS under test but is a means to provide OTA
power levels which are representative of a co-located system, further
defined in clause 4.9.

For a *BS type 1-O* the transceiver unit array must contain at least 8
transmitter units and at least 8 receiver units. Transmitter units and
receiver units may be combined into transceiver units. The
transmitter/receiver units have the ability to transmit/receive parallel
independent modulated symbol streams.

## 4.4 Base station classes

The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Stations,
Medium Range Base Stations and Local Area Base Stations unless otherwise
stated. The associated deployment scenarios for each class are exactly
the same for BS with and without connectors.

For BS *type 1-O* and 2-O, BS classes are defined as indicated below:

\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 35 m.

\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 5 m.

\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 2 m.

For *BS type 1-C* and 1-H, BS classes are defined as indicated below:

\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to
70 dB.

\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals
to 53 dB.

\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to
45 dB.

NOTE: Local Are Base stations are applicable also in Femto Cell
scenarios.

For BS *type 1-C, 1-H and 1-O,* HAPS BS class is defined as indicated
below:

> \- HAPS Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
> High Altitude Platform scenarios with a BS to ground UE minimum
> distance of typically around 20km.

\- Unless otherwise stated, HAPS BS class would refer to Wide Area BS
class, which is specified in clause 4.4.

## 4.5 Regional requirements

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements
set by local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances the regional
requirements apply, since this is defined by local or regional
regulation.

Table 4.5-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions.

## 4.7 Requirements for contiguous and *non-contiguous spectrum*

A spectrum allocation where a BS operates can either be contiguous or
non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for BS configured for both *contiguous spectrum*
operation and *non-contiguous spectrum* operation.

For BS operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, some requirements apply
both at the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* and inside the *sub-block
gaps*. For each such requirement, it is stated how the limits apply
relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* and the *sub-block*
edges respectively.

## 4.8 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation

For *multi-band connector* or *multi-band* *RIB*, the RF requirements in
clause 6, 7, 9 and 10 apply separately to each supported *operating
band* unless otherwise stated. For some requirements, it is explicitly
stated that specific additions or exclusions to the requirement apply at
*multi-band connector(s)*, and *multi-band RIB(s)* as detailed in the
requirement clause. For *BS* capable of multi-band operation, various
structures in terms of combinations of different transmitter and
receiver implementations (multi-band or single band) with mapping of
transceivers to one or more *antenna* *connectors* for *BS type 1-C* or
*TAB connectors* for *BS type 1-H* in different ways are possible. For
*multi-band connector(s)* the exclusions or provisions for multi-band
apply. For *single-band connector(s)*, the following applies:

\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, *operating band* unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious
emissions requirements apply to this *connector* that is mapped to
single-band.

\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, single-band
requirements shall apply to this *connector* configured for single-band
operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS are
applicable. Single-band requirements are tested separately at the
*connector* configured for single-band operation, with all other
*antenna connectors* terminated.

A *BS type 1-H* may be capable of supporting operation in multiple
*operating bands* with one of the following implementations of *TAB
connectors* in the *transceiver array boundary*:

\- All *TAB connectors* are *single-band connectors*.

\- Different sets of *single-band connectors* support different
*operating bands*, but each *TAB connector* supports only operation in
one single *operating band*.

\- Sets of *single-band connectors* support operation in multiple
*operating bands* with some *single-band connectors* supporting more
than one *operating band*.

\- All *TAB connectors* are multi-band *connectors*.

\- A combination of single-band sets and multi-band sets of *TAB
connectors* provides support of the type *BS type 1-H* capability of
operation in multiple *operating bands*.

Unless otherwise stated all requirements specified for an *operating
band* apply only to the set of *TAB connectors* supporting that
*operating band*.

In the case of an *operating band* being supported only by *single-band
connectors* in a *TAB connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector
RX min cell group*, *single-band requirements* apply to that set of *TAB
connectors*.

In the case of an *operating band* being supported only by *multi-band
connector*s supporting the same *operating band* combination in a *TAB
connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group*,
*multi-band requirements* apply to that set of *TAB connectors*.

The case of an *operating band* being supported by both *multi-band
connectors* and *single-band connectors* in a *TAB connector TX min cell
group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group* is not covered by the
present release of this specification.

The case of an *operating band* being supported by *multi-band
connectors* which are not all supporting the same *operating band*
combination in a *TAB connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector
RX min cell group* is not covered by the present release of this
specification.

*BS type 1-O* may be capable of supporting operation in multiple
*operating bands* with one of the following implementations at the
*radiated interface boundary*:

\- All RIBs are *single-band RIBs*.

\- All RIBs are *multi-band* *RIBs*.

\- A combination of single-band *RIBs* and *multi-band RIBs* provides
support of the *BS type 1-O* capability of operation in multiple
*operating bands*.

For *multi-band connectors* and *multi-band RIBs* supporting the bands
for TDD, the RF requirements in the present specification assume no
simultaneous uplink and downlink occur between the bands.

The RF requirements for *multi-band connectors* and *multi-band RIBs*
supporting bands for both FDD and TDD are not covered by the present
release of this specification.

## 4.9 OTA co-location with other base stations

Co-location requirements are requirements which are based on assuming
the *BS type 1-O* is co-located with another BS of the same base station
class, they ensure that both co-located systems can operate with minimal
degradation to each other.

Unwanted emission and out of band blocking co-location requirements are
optional requirements based on declaration. TX OFF and TX IMD are
mandatory requirements and have the form of a co-location requirement as
it represents the worst-case scenario of all the interference cases.

NOTE: Due to the low level of the unwanted emissions for the spurious
emissions and TX OFF level co-location is the most suitable method to
show conformance.

The *co-location reference antenna* shall be a single column passive
antenna which has the same vertical radiating dimension (h), frequency
range, polarization, as the composite antenna of the *BS type 1-O* and
nominal 65° horizontal half-power beamwidth (suitable for 3-sector
deployment) and is placed at a distance *d* from the edge of the *BS
type 1-O*, as shown in figure 4.9-1.

![](./38104/media/image8.emf){width="6.680555555555555in"
height="4.041666666666667in"}

Figure 4.9-1: Illustration of *BS type 1-O* enclosure and co-location
reference antenna

Edge-to-edge separation *d* between the *BS type 1-O* and the
*co-location reference antenna* shall be set to 0.1 m.

The *BS type 1-O* and the *co-location reference antenna* shall be
aligned in a common plane perpendicular to the mechanical bore-sight
direction, as shown in figure 4.9-1.

The *co-location reference antenna* and the *BS type 1-O* can have
different width.

The vertical radiating regions of the *co-location reference antenna*
and the *BS type 1-O* composite antenna shall be aligned.

For co-location requirements where the frequency range of the signal at
the *co-location reference antenna* is different from the *BS type 1-O*,
a *co-location reference antenna* suitable for the frequency stated in
the requirement is assumed.

OTA co-location requirements are based on the power at the conducted
interface of a *co-location reference antenna*, depending on the
requirement this interface is either an input or an output. For *BS type
1-O* with dual polarization *the co-location reference antenna* has two
conducted interfaces each representing one polarization.

#  5 *Operating bands* and channel arrangement

## 5.1 General

The channel arrangements presented in this clause are based on the
*operating bands* and *BS channel bandwidths* defined in the present
release of specifications.

NOTE: Other *operating bands* and *BS channel bandwidth*s may be
considered in future releases.

Requirements throughout the RF specifications are in many cases defined
separately for different frequency ranges (FR). The frequency ranges in
which NR can operate according to the present version of the
specification are identified as described in table 5.1-1. Whenever FR2
is referred, both FR2-1 and FR2-2 frequency sub-ranges shall be applied,
unless otherwise stated.

## 5.2 *Operating bands*

NR is designed to operate in the *operating bands* defined in
table 5.2-1 and 5.2-2.

NR operating band n1, which is defined in Table 5.2-1, can be applied
for HAPS operation.

NB-IoT is designed to operate in the NR operating bands n1, n2, n3, n5,
n7, n8, n12, n13, n14, n18, n20, n25, n26, n28, n41, n65, n66, n70, n71,
n74, n85, n90 which are defined in Table 5.2-1.

## 5.3 *BS channel bandwidth*

### 5.3.1 General

The *BS channel bandwidth* supports a single NR RF carrier in the uplink
or downlink at the Base Station. Different UE channel bandwidths may be
supported within the same spectrum for transmitting to and receiving
from UEs connected to the BS. The placement of the UE channel bandwidth
is flexible but can only be completely within the *BS channel
bandwidth*. The BS shall be able to transmit to and/or receive from one
or more UE bandwidth parts that are smaller than or equal to the number
of carrier resource blocks on the RF carrier, in any part of the carrier
resource blocks.

The relationship between the channel bandwidth, the guardband and the
*transmission bandwidth configuration* is shown in figure 5.3.1-1.

![](./38104/media/image9.emf).

Figure 5.3.1-1: Definition of channel bandwidth and *transmission
bandwidth configuration* for one NR channel

### 5.3.2 *Transmission bandwidth configuration*

The *transmission bandwidth configuration* N~RB~ for each *BS channel
bandwidth* and subcarrier spacing is specified in table 5.3.2.-1 for FR1
and table 5.3.2-2 for FR2.

The minimum guardband of SCS 240 kHz SS/PBCH block for each *BS channel
bandwidth* is specified in table 5.3.3-3 for FR2.

Table 5.3.3-3: Minimum guardband (kHz) of SCS 240 kHz SS/PBCH block
(FR2)

  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------

NOTE: The minimum guardband in Table 5.3.3-3 is applicable only when the
SCS 240 kHz SS/PBCH block is placed adjacent to the edge of the *BS
channel bandwidth* within which the SS/PBCH block is located.

The number of RBs configured in any *BS channel bandwidth* shall ensure
that the minimum guardband specified in this clause is met.

Figure 5.3.3-1: BS PRB utilization

In the case that multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same
symbol, the minimum guardband on each side of the carrier is the
guardband applied at the configured *BS channel bandwidth* for the
numerology that is transmitted/received immediately adjacent to the
guard band.

For FR1, if multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same symbol and
the *BS channel bandwidth* is \>50 MHz, the guardband applied adjacent
to 15 kHz SCS shall be the same as the guardband defined for 30 kHz SCS
for the same *BS channel bandwidth*.

For FR2, if multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same symbol and
the *BS channel bandwidth* is \>200 MHz, the guardband applied adjacent
to 60 kHz SCS shall be the same as the guardband defined for 120 kHz SCS
for the same *BS channel bandwidth*.

Figure 5.3.3-2: Guard band definition when transmitting multiple
numerologies

NOTE: Figure 5.3.3-2 is not intended to imply the size of any guard
between the two numerologies. Inter-numerology guard band within the
carrier is implementation dependent.

### 5.3.4 RB alignment

For each *BS channel bandwidth* and each numerology, *BS transmission
bandwidth configuration* must fulfil the minimum guardband requirement
specified in clause 5.3.3.

For each numerology, its common resource blocks are specified in clause
4.4.4.3 in \[9\], and the starting point of its *transmission bandwidth
configuration* on the common resource block grid for a given channel
bandwidth is indicated by an offset to "Reference point A" in the unit
of the numerology.

For each numerology, all *UE transmission bandwidth configurations*
indicated to UEs served by the BS by higher layer parameter
*carrierBandwidth* defined in TS 38.331 \[11\] shall fall within the *BS
transmission bandwidth configuration*.

### 5.3.5 *BS channel bandwidth* per *operating band*

The requirements in this specification apply to the combination of *BS
channel bandwidths*, SCS and *operating bands* shown in table 5.3.5-1
for FR1 and in table 5.3.5-2 and table 5.3.5-3 for FR2. The
*transmission bandwidth configuration* in table 5.3.2-1, table 5.3.2-2
and table 5.3.2-3 shall be supported for each of the *BS channel
bandwidths* within the BS capability. The *BS channel bandwidths* are
specified for both the Tx and Rx path.

## 5.3A *BS channel bandwidth* for CA

### 5.3A.1 *Transmission bandwidth configuration* for CA

For *carrier aggregation*, the *transmission bandwidth configuration* is
defined per component carrier and the requirement is specified in clause
5.3.2.

### 5.3A.2 Minimum guardband and *transmission bandwidth configuration* for CA

For intra-band contiguous *carrier aggregation*, *Aggregated BS Channel
Bandwidth* and *Guard Bands* are defined as follows, see Figure
5.3A.2-1.

Figure 5.3A.2-1: Definition of *Aggregated BS Channel Bandwidth* for
intra-band *carrier aggregation*

The *aggregated BS Channel Bandwidth*, BW~Channel_CA**,**~ is defined as

BW~Channel_CA~ = F~edge,high~ - F~edge,low~ (MHz)

The lower bandwidth edge F~edge,\ low~ and the upper bandwidth edge
F~edge,high~ of the *aggregated BS channel bandwidth* are used as
frequency reference points for transmitter and receiver requirements and
are defined by

F~edge,low~ = F~C,low~ - F~offset,low~

F~edge,high~ = F~C,high~ + F~offset,high~

The lower and upper frequency offsets depend on the *transmission
bandwidth configurations* of the lowest and highest assigned edge
component carrier and are defined as

F~offset,low~ = (N~RB,low~\*12 + 1)\*SCS~low~/2 + BW~GB,low~ (MHz)

F~offset,high~ = (N~RB,high~\*12 - 1)\*SCS~high~/2 + BW~GB,high~ (MHz)

N~RB,low~ and N~RB,high~ are the *transmission bandwidth configurations*
according to Table 5.3.2-1 or Table 5.3.2-2 or Table 5.3.2-3 for the
lowest and highest assigned component carrier, SCS~low~ and SCS~high~
are the sub-carrier spacing for the lowest and highest assigned
component carrier respectively. SCS~low~, SCS~high~, N~RB,low~,
N~RB,high~, BW~GB,low~ and BW~GB,high~ use the largest μ value among the
subcarrier spacing configurations supported in the operating band for
both of the channel bandwidths according to Table 5.3.5-1 and BW~GB,low~
and BW~GB,high~ are the minimum guard band for lowest and highest
assigned component carrier according to Table 5.3.3-1 for the said *μ*
value. In case there is no common μ value for both of the channel
bandwidths, *μ*=1 is used for SCS~low~, SCS~high~, N~RB,low~,
N~RB,high~, BW~GB,low~ and BW~GB,high~.

For *intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation* *sub-block
bandwidth* and *sub-block edges* are defined as follows, see figure
5.3A.2-2.

Figure 5.3A.2-2: Definition of *sub-block bandwidth* for intra-band
*non-contiguous spectrum*

The *lower sub-block edge* of the *sub-block bandwidth*
(BW~Channel,block~) is defined as follows:

F~edge,block,\ low~ = F~C,block,low~ - F~offset,low~

The upper *sub-block* edge of the *sub-block bandwidth* is defined as
follows:

F~edge,block,high~ = F~C,block,high~ + F~offset,high~

The *sub-block bandwidth*, BW~Channel,block~, is defined as follows:

BW~Channel,block~ = F~edge,block,high\ -~ F~edge,block,low~ (MHz)

The lower and upper frequency offsets F~offset,block,low~ and
F~offset,block,high~ depend on the *transmission bandwidth
configurations* of the lowest and highest assigned edge component
carriers within a *sub-block* and are defined as

F~offset,block,low~ = (N~RB,low~\*12 + 1)\*SCS~low~/2 + BW~GB,low~ (MHz)

F~offset,block,high~ = (N~RB,high~\*12 - 1)\*SCS~high~/2 + BW~GB,high~
(MHz)

where N~RB,low~ and N~RB,high~ are the *transmission bandwidth
configurations* according to Table 5.3.2-1 or Table 5.3.2-2 for the
lowest and highest assigned component carrier within a *sub-block*,
respectively. SCS~low~ and SCS~high~ are the sub-carrier spacing for the
lowest and highest assigned component carrier within a *sub-block*,
respectively. SCS~low~, SCS~high~, N~RB,low~, N~RB,high~, BW~GB,low~ and
BW~GB,high~ use the largest μ value among the subcarrier spacing
configurations supported in the operating band for both of the channel
bandwidths according to Table 5.3.5-1 and BW~GB,low~ and BW~GB,high~ are
the minimum guard band for lowest and highest assigned component carrier
according to Table 5.3.3-1 for the said *μ* value. In case there is no
common μ value for both of the channel bandwidths, *μ*=1 is used for
SCS~low~, SCS~high~, N~RB,low~, N~RB,high~, BW~GB,low~ and BW~GB,high~.

The *sub-block gap size* between two consecutive *sub-blocks* W~gap~ is
defined as follows:

W~gap~ = F~edge,block\ n+1,low~ - F~edge,block\ n,high~ (MHz)

## 5.4 Channel arrangement

### 5.4.1 Channel spacing

#### 5.4.1.1 Channel spacing for adjacent NR carriers

The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the
size of the frequency block available and the *BS channel bandwidths*.
The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent NR carriers is defined
as following:

\- For NR FR1 *operating bands* with 100 kHz channel raster,

▪ Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2

\- For NR FR1 *operating bands* with 15 kHz channel raster,

▪ Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-5
kHz, 0 kHz, 5 kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 15 kHz

▪ Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-10
kHz, 0 kHz, 10 kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 30 kHz

\- For NR FR2 *operating bands* with 60 kHz channel raster,

▪ Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-20
kHz, 0 kHz, 20 kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 60 kHz

▪ Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-40
kHz, 0 kHz, 40 kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 120 kHz

\- For operating band n263

▪ Nominal Channel spacing = ceil((BW~Channel(1)~ +
BW~Channel(2)~)/100.8)\*50.4 MHz,

where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the *BS channel bandwidths*
of the two respective NR carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted
depending on the channel raster to optimize performance in a particular
deployment scenario.

#### 5.4.1.2 Channel spacing for CA

For intra-band contiguously aggregated carriers, the channel spacing
between adjacent component carriers shall be multiple of least common
multiple of channel raster and sub-carrier spacing.

The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent aggregated NR carriers
is defined as follows:

For NR *operating bands* with 100 kHz channel raster:

$\text{Nominal}\mspace{6mu}\text{channel}\mspace{6mu}\text{spacing} = \left\lfloor \frac{BW_{Channel(1)} + BW_{Channel(2)} - 2\left| GB_{Channel(1)} - GB_{Channel(2)} \right|}{0.6} \right\rfloor 0.3\mspace{6mu}(\text{MHz)}$

For NR *operating bands* with 15 kHz channel raster:

$\text{Nominal}\mspace{6mu}\text{channel}\mspace{6mu}\text{spacing} = \left\lfloor \frac{BW_{Channel(1)} + BW_{Channel(2)} - 2\left| GB_{Channel(1)} - GB_{Channel(2)} \right|}{0.015*2^{n + 1}} \right\rfloor 0.015*2^{n}\mspace{6mu}(\text{MHz)}$

with

$n = \mu_{0}$

For NR *operating bands* with 60kHz channel raster:

$\text{Nominal}\mspace{6mu}\text{channel}\mspace{6mu}\text{spacing} = \left\lfloor \frac{BW_{Channel(1)} + BW_{Channel(2)} - 2\left| GB_{Channel(1)} - GB_{Channel(2)} \right|}{0.06*2^{n + 1}} \right\rfloor 0.06*2^{n}\mspace{6mu}(\text{MHz)}$

with

$n = \mu_{0} - 2$

For operating band n263

> Nominal Channel spacing = ceil((BW~Channel(1)~ +
> BW~Channel(2)~)/100.8)\*50.4 MHz,

where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the *BS channel bandwidths*
of the two respective NR component carriers according to Table 5.3.2-1,
5.3.2-2 and 5.3.2-3 with values in MHz, $\mu_{0}\ $the largest $\mu$
value among the subcarrier spacing configurations supported in the
operating band for both of the channel bandwidths according to Table
5.3.5-1 and Table 5.3.5-2 and *GB~Channel(i)~* the minimum guard band
for channel bandwidth *i* according to Table 5.3.3-1, Table 5.3.3-2 and
Table 5.3.3-2a for the said $\mu$ value, with $\mu$ as defined in TS
38.211 \[9\]. In case there is no common μ value for both of the channel
bandwidths, μ~0~=1 is selected for NR *operating bands* with 15 kHz
channel raster and *GB~Channel(i)~* is the minimum guard band for
channel bandwidth i according to Table 5.3.3-1 for *μ*=1 with *μ* as
defined in TS 38.211\[9\].

The channel spacing for *intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation* can
be adjusted to any multiple of least common multiple of channel raster
and sub-carrier spacing less than the nominal channel spacing to
optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario.

For *intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation*, the channel spacing
between two NR component carriers in different *sub-blocks* shall be
larger than the nominal channel spacing defined in this clause.

### 5.4.2 Channel raster

#### 5.4.2.1 NR-ARFCN and channel raster

The global frequency raster defines a set of *RF reference frequencies*
F~REF~. The *RF reference frequency* is used in signalling to identify
the position of RF channels, SS blocks and other elements. The global
frequency raster is defined for all frequencies from 0 to 100 GHz. The
granularity of the global frequency raster is ΔF~Global~.

*RF reference frequencies* are designated by an NR Absolute Radio
Frequency Channel Number (NR-ARFCN) in the range \[0...3279165\] on the
global frequency raster. The relation between the NR-ARFCN and the *RF
reference frequency* F~REF~ in MHz is given by the following equation,
where F~REF-Offs~ and N~Ref-Offs~ are given in table 5.4.2.1-1 and
N~REF~ is the NR-ARFCN.

F~REF~ = F~REF-Offs~ + ΔF~Global~ (N~REF~ -- N~REF-Offs~)

Table 5.4.2.1-1: NR-ARFCN parameters for the global frequency raster

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The *channel raster* defines a subset of *RF reference frequencies* that
can be used to identify the RF channel position in the uplink and
downlink. The *RF reference frequency* for an RF channel maps to a
resource element on the carrier. For each *operating band*, a subset of
frequencies from the global frequency raster are applicable for that
band and forms a channel raster with a granularity ΔF~Raster~, which may
be equal to or larger than ΔF~Global~.

For SUL bands except n95, n97, n98 and for the uplink of all FDD bands
defined in table 5.2-1, for TDD bands n34, n38, n39, n48, n90, and n40,

F~REF,shift~ = F~REF~ + Δ~shift~, where Δ~shift~ = 0 kHz or 7.5 kHz

where Δ~shift~ is signalled by the network in higher layer parameter
*frequencyShift7p5khz* as defined in TS 38.331 \[11\].

For bands n34, n38, n39, n48 and n40, F~REF,\ shift~ is only applicable
to uplink transmissions using a 15 kHz SCS.

The mapping between the *channel raster* and corresponding resource
element is given in clause 5.4.2.2. The applicable entries for each
*operating band* are defined in clause 5.4.2.3.

#### 5.4.2.1A NB-IoT carrier frequency numbering

The NB-IoT carrier frequency numbering (EARFCN) is defined in clause 5.7
of TS 36.104 \[4\].

#### 5.4.2.2 Channel raster to resource element mapping

The mapping between the *RF reference frequency* on the channel raster
and the corresponding resource element is given in table 5.4.2.2-1 and
can be used to identify the RF channel position. The mapping depends on
the total number of RBs that are allocated in the channel and applies to
both UL and DL. The mapping must apply to at least one numerology
supported by the BS.

#### 5.4.2.3 Channel raster entries for each *operating band*

The RF channel positions on the channel raster in each NR *operating
band* are given through the applicable NR-ARFCN in table 5.4.2.3-1 for
FR1 and table 5.4.2.3-2 for FR2, using the channel raster to resource
element mapping in clause 5.4.2.2.

\- For NR *operating bands* with 100 kHz channel raster, ΔF~Raster~ = 20
× ΔF~Global~. In this case, every 20^th^ NR-ARFCN within the *operating
band* are applicable for the channel raster within the *operating band*
and the step size for the channel raster in table 5.4.2.3-1 is given as
\<20\>.

\- For NR *operating bands* with 15 kHz channel raster below 3 GHz,
ΔF~Raster~ = *I* × ΔF~Global~, where *I* ϵ {3,6}. In this case, every
*I^th^* NR‑ARFCN within the *operating band* are applicable for the
channel raster within the *operating band* and the step size for the
channel raster in table 5.4.2.3-1 is given as \<*I*\>.

\- For NR *operating bands* with 15 kHz and 60 kHz channel raster above
3 GHz, ΔF~Raster~ = *I* ×ΔF~Global~, where *I* ϵ {1, 2}. In this case,
every *I^th^* NR‑ARFCN within the *operating band* are applicable for
the channel raster within the *operating band* and the step size for the
channel raster in table 5.4.2.3-1 and table 5.4.2.3-2 is given as
\<*I*\>.

\- For frequency bands with two ΔF~Raster~ in FR1, the higher ΔF~Raster~
applies to channels using only the SCS that is equal to or larger than
the higher ΔF~Raster~ and SSB SCS is equal to the higher ΔF~Raster~.

\- For frequency bands with two ΔF~Raster~ in FR2, the higher ΔF~Raster~
applies to channels using only the SCS that is equal to the higher
ΔF~Raster~ and the SSB SCS that is equal to or larger than the higher
ΔF~Raster~.

### 5.4.3 Synchronization raster

#### 5.4.3.1 Synchronization raster and numbering

The synchronization raster indicates the frequency positions of the
synchronization block that can be used by the UE for system acquisition
when explicit signalling of the synchronization block position is not
present.

A global synchronization raster is defined for all frequencies. The
frequency position of the SS block is defined as SS~REF~ with
corresponding number GSCN. The parameters defining the SS~REF~ and GSCN
for all the frequency ranges are in table 5.4.3.1-1 for above 3 MHz
channel bandwidth and in table 5.4.3.1-2 for 3 MHz channel bandwidth.

For band n100, additional parameters defining the SS~REF~ and GSCN are
specified in table 5.4.3.1-3.

The resource element corresponding to the SS block reference frequency
SS~REF~ is given in clause 5.4.3.2. The synchronization raster and the
subcarrier spacing of the synchronization block is defined separately
for each band.

#  6 Conducted transmitter characteristics

## 6.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, the conducted transmitter characteristics are
specified at the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB
connector* for *BS type 1-H*, with a full complement of transceiver
units for the configuration in normal operating conditions.

For *BS type 1-H* the manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of
supported geographical cells (i.e. geographical areas covered by beams).
The minimum number of supported geographical cells (N~cells~) relates to
the BS setting with the minimum amount of cell splitting supported with
transmission on all *TAB connectors* supporting the *operating band*, or
with minimum amount of transmitted beams.

For *BS type 1-H* manufacturer shall also declare *TAB connector TX min
cell groups*. Every *TAB connector* of the *BS type 1-H* supporting
transmission in an *operating band* shall map to one *TAB connector* *TX
min cell group* supporting the same *operating band*, where mapping of
*TAB connector*s to cells/beams is implementation dependent.

The number of *active transmitter units* that are considered when
calculating the conducted TX emissions limits (N~TXU,counted~) for *BS
type 1-H* is calculated as follows:

N~TXU,counted~ = *min(N~TXU,active~ , 8×N~cells~)*

N~TXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of *basic limits* and is
derived as N~TXU,countedpercell~ = N~TXU,counted~ / N~cells~

NOTE: N~TXU,active~ depends on the actual number of *active transmitter
unit*s and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

For BS *type 1-H* there is no requirement specified for band n46, n100
and n101 and n102.

## 6.2 Base station output power

### 6.2.1 General

In addition, for operation with shared spectrum channel access
operation, the BS may have to comply with the applicable BS power limits
established regionally, when deployed in regions where those limits
apply and under the conditions declared by the manufacturer.

### 6.2.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C*

In normal conditions, P~max,c,AC~ shall remain within +2 dB and -2 dB of
the *rated carrier output power* P~rated,c,AC~, declared by the
manufacturer.

In extreme conditions, P~max,c,AC~ shall remain within +2.5 dB and -2.5
dB of the *rated carrier output power* P~rated,c,AC~, declared by the
manufacturer.

In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may
apply also for some conditions outside the range of conditions defined
as normal.

NOTE: For NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, the NR carrier and NB-IoT
carrier shall be seen as a single carrier occupied NR channel bandwidth,
the output power over this carrier is shared between NR and NB-IoT. This
note shall apply for P~max,c,AC~ and P~rated,c,AC~.

### 6.2.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H*

In normal conditions, P~max,c,TABC~ shall remain within +2 dB and -2 dB
of the *rated carrier output power* P~rated,c,TABC~ for each *TAB
connector* as declared by the manufacturer.

In extreme conditions, P~max,c,TABC~ shall remain within +2.5 dB and
-2.5 dB of the *rated carrier output power* P~rated,c,TABC~ for each
*TAB connector* as declared by the manufacturer.

In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may
apply also for some conditions outside the range of conditions defined
as normal.

### 6.2.4 Additional requirements (regional)

In certain regions, additional regional requirements may apply.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the rated output power,
P~rated,c.sys~ for BS type 1-H or sum of P~rated,c,AC~ over all *antenna
connectors* for BS type 1-C declared by the manufacturer shall be equal
to or less than 20 W per 10 MHz bandwidth.

For band n100 in CEPT countries, P~rated,c,AC~ of the WA BS shall not
exceed 51.5 dBm/5MHz + (f~DL~-922.1) x 40/3 dB, with f~DL~ being the
centre frequency in MHz. This limit is derived from ECC Decision(20)02
\[21\] assuming a 17 dBi maximum antenna gain and 4 dB losses, and
assuming one antenna connector. The above rated output power limit for
band n100 applies to uncoordinated deployments and in case of
coordinated deployments, higher output power values may be allowed.

NOTE: for more details on the maximum level derivation, refer to TR
38.853 \[23\].

NOTE: The additional maximum output power requirement for 3 MHz channel
bandwidth will be updated in a later version, based on CEPT WG FM's
feedback.

For band n101 in CEPT countries, P~rated,c,AC~ shall not exceed 51
dBm/10MHz or 48 dBm/5MHz. This limit is derived from ECC Decision(20)02
\[21\] assuming a 18 dBi maximum antenna gain and 4 dB losses, and
assuming one antenna connector. The above rated output power limit for
band n101 applies to uncoordinated deployments and in case of
coordinated deployments, higher output power values may be allowed.

NOTE: for more details on the maximum level derivation, refer to TR
38.852 \[22\].

## 6.4 Transmit ON/OFF power

### 6.4.1 Transmitter OFF power

#### 6.4.1.1 General

Transmit OFF power requirements apply only to TDD operation of the BS.

filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the *transmission
bandwidth configuration* of the BS (BW~Config~) centred on the assigned
channel frequency during the *transmitter OFF period*. N = SCS/15, where
SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz.

For *multi-band connectors* and for *single band connectors* supporting
transmission in multiple *operating bands*, the requirement is only
applicable during the *transmitter OFF period* in all supported
*operating bands*.

For BS supporting intra-band contiguous CA, the transmitter OFF power is
defined as the mean power measured over 70/N us filtered with a square
filter of bandwidth equal to the *Aggregated BS Channel Bandwidth*
BW~Channel_CA~ centred on (F~edge,high~+F~edge,low~)/2 during the
*transmitter OFF period*. N = SCS/15, where SCS is the smallest
supported Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz in the *Aggregated BS Channel
Bandwidth*.

density shall be less than -85 dBm/MHz per *TAB connector*.

### 6.4.2 *Transmitter transient period*

#### 6.4.2.1 General

*Transmitter transient period* requirements apply only to TDD operation
of the BS.

The *transmitter transient period* is the time period during which the
transmitter is changing from the *transmitter OFF period* to the
*transmitter ON period* or vice versa. The *transmitter transient
period* is illustrated in figure 6.4.2.1-1.

Figure 6.4.2.1-1: Example of relations between transmitter ON period,
transmitter OFF period and *transmitter transient period*

For *BS type 1-C* this requirement shall be applied at the *antenna
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.4.2.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* 1-H

For *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*, the *transmitter transient period*
shall be shorter than the values listed in the minimum requirement table
6.4.2.2-1.

The requirements in clause 6.5.1 apply to the *transmitter ON period*.

Frequency error is the measure of the difference between the actual BS
transmit frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source shall be
used for RF frequency and data clock generation.

For *BS type 1-C* this requirement shall be applied at the *antenna
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.5.1.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

For *BS type 1-C* and *BS type* 1-H, the modulated carrier frequency of
each NR carrier configured by the BS shall be accurate to within the
accuracy range given in table 6.5.1.2-1 observed over 1 ms.

The frequency error requirement for NB-IoT are specified in TS 36.104

### 6.5.2 Modulation quality

#### 6.5.2.1 General

Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured
carrier signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be
expressed as Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). The Error Vector Magnitude is
a measure of the difference between the ideal symbols and the measured
symbols after the equalization. This difference is called the error
vector. Details about how the EVM is determined are specified in Annex
B.

For *BS type 1-C* this requirement shall be applied at the *antenna
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.5.2.2 Minimum Requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

For *BS type 1-C* and *1-H*, the EVM levels of each NR carrier for
different modulation schemes on PDSCH outlined in table 6.5.2.2-1 shall

*carrier aggregation* and their combinations.

Frames of the NR signals present at the BS transmitter *antenna
connectors* or *TAB connectors* are not perfectly aligned in time. The
RF signals present at the BS transmitter *antenna connectors* or
*transceiver array boundary* may experience certain timing differences
in relation to each other.

The TAE is specified for a specific set of signals/transmitter
configuration/transmission mode.

For *BS type 1-C*, the TAE is defined as the largest timing difference
between any two signals belonging to different *antenna connectors* for
a specific set of signals/transmitter configuration/transmission mode.

For *BS type 1-H*, the TAE is defined as the largest timing difference
between any two signals belonging to *TAB connectors* belonging to
different transmitter groups at the *transceiver array boundary*, where
transmitter groups are associated with the *TAB connectors* in the
transceiver unit array corresponding to MIMO transmission, *carrier
aggregation* for a specific set of signals/transmitter
configuration/transmission mode.

#### 6.5.3.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type* 1-H

For MIMO transmission, at each carrier frequency, TAE shall not exceed
65 ns.

For *intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation*, with or without MIMO,
TAE shall not exceed 260ns.

For *intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation*, with or without
MIMO, TAE shall not exceed 3µs.

For inter-band *carrier aggregation*, with or without MIMO, TAE shall
not exceed 3µs.

The time alignment error requirements for NB-IoT are specified in TS
36.104 \[13\] clause 6.5.3.

## 6.6 Unwanted emissions

### 6.6.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions \[2\]. In ITU terminology, out of
band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the *BS
channel bandwidth* resulting from the modulation process and
non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions.
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for the BS transmitter is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
and *operating band* unwanted emissions (OBUE).

The maximum offset of the *operating band* unwanted emissions mask from
the *operating band* edge is Δf~OBUE~. The Operating band unwanted
emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink
*operating band* plus the frequency ranges Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~
below each band. Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are
limited by a spurious emissions requirement.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6.1-1 for the NR
*operating bands*.

Table 6.6.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink *operating
band*

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

For band n46, n96 and n102, the values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table
6.6.1-1a.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

For *BS type 1-H* the unwanted emission requirements are applied per the
*TAB connector TX min cell groups* for all the configurations supported
by the BS. The *basic limits* and corresponding emissions scaling are
defined in each relevant clause.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.

### 6.6.2 Occupied bandwidth

#### 6.6.2.1 General

The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted
are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also Recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[3\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The occupied bandwidth requirement shall apply during the *transmitter
ON period* for a single transmitted carrier. The minimum requirement
below may be applied regionally. There may also be regional requirements
to declare the occupied bandwidth according to the definition in the
present clause.

For *BS type 1-C* this requirement shall be applied at the *antenna
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* this requirement shall be appliedat each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

The occupied bandwidth for each NR carrier shall be less than the *BS
channel bandwidth*. For intra-band contiguous CA, the occupied bandwidth
shall be less than or equal the *Aggregated BS Channel Bandwidth*.

For NB.IoT operation in NR in-band, the occupied bandwidth for each NR
carrier with NB-IoT shall be less than than the *BS channel bandwidth*.

### 6.6.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio

#### 6.6.3.1 General

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

The requirements shall apply outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth* whatever the type of transmitter considered (single
carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the
manufacturer's specification.

The requirements shall also apply if the BS supports NB-IoT operation in
NR in-band.

For a BS operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the ACLR requirement in
clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub-block gaps*, while the CACLR
requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub-block gaps*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2
shall apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps*, while the CACLR requirement in
clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps*.

The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter ON period*.

#### 6.6.3.2 Limits and *Basic limits*

The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal
(BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter
centred on the adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.

For operation in paired and unpaired spectrum, the ACLR shall be higher
than the value specified in table 6.6.3.2‑1 in any operating band except
for band n46, n96 and n102.

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a
*sub-block gap* or the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *sub-block
gap* or the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective *sub-block* edges or *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges*.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 6.6.3.2-3 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined in
table 6.6.3.2-4.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* or multiple bands, the CACLR
for NR carriers located on either side of the *sub-block gap* or the
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap* shall be higher than the value specified in
table 6.6.3.2-3.

The CACLR requirements in Table 6.6.3.2-3 apply to BS that supports NR,
in any operating band except for band n46, n96 and n102. The CACLR
requirements for band n46, n96 and n102 are in Table 6.6.3.2-3aa.

#### 6.6.3.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C*

The ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limits* in table 6.6.3.2-2, 6.6.3.2-3a
or the ACLR (CACLR) *limits* in table 6.6.3.2-1, 6.6.3.2-2a or
6.6.3.2-3, whichever is less stringent, shall apply for each *antenna
connector*.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, absolute ACLR limits shall be
applied to the sum of the absolute ACLR power over all *antenna
connectors* for *BS type 1-C*.

#### 6.6.3.4 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H*

The ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limits* in table 6.6.3.2-2 + X,
6.6.3.2-3a + X (where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~)) or the ACLR
(CACLR) *limits* in table 6.6.3.2-1, 6.6.3.2-2a or 6.6.3.2-3, whichever
is less stringent, shall apply for each *TAB connector TX min cell
group*.

NOTE: Conformance to the *BS type 1-H* ACLR requirement can be
demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The ratio of the sum of the filtered mean power measured on each
*TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the assigned
channel frequency to the sum of the filtered mean power measured on each
*TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the adjacent
channel frequency shall be greater than or equal to the ACLR *basic
limit* of the BS. This shall apply for each *TAB connector TX min cell
group*.

Or

2\) The ratio of the filtered mean power at the *TAB connector* centred
on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power at this
*TAB connector* centred on the adjacent channel frequency shall be
greater than or equal to the ACLR *basic limit* of the BS for every *TAB
connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*, for each *TAB
connector TX min cell group*.

In case the ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limit* of *BS type 1-H* are
applied, the conformance can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of
the following criteria as determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the filtered mean power measured on each *TAB connector*
in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the adjacent channel
frequency shall be less than or equal to the ACLR (CACLR) absolute
ba*sic limit* + X of the BS. This shall apply to each *TAB* connector
*TX min cell group.*

Or

2\) The filtered mean power at each *TAB connector* centred on the
adjacent channel frequency shall be less than or equal to the ACLR
(CACLR) absolute *basic limit* of the BS scaled by X -10log~10~(*n*) for
every *TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*, for each
*TAB connector TX min cell group*, where *n* is the number of *TAB
connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group.*

### 6.6.4 Operating band unwanted emissions 

#### 6.6.4.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE)
limits in FR1 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of
each supported downlink *operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*. The
values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6.1‑1 for the NR *operating
bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's
specification. In addition, for a BS operating in *non-contiguous
spectrum*, the requirements apply inside any *sub-block gap*. In
addition, for a BS operating in multiple bands, the requirements apply
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

*Basic limits* are specified in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *channel edge* frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f_offset is the separation between the *channel edge* frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.6.1-1.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector* inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* with
W~gap~ \< 2\*Δf~OBUE~, a combined *basic* limit shall be applied which
is the cumulative sum of the *basic limit*s specified at the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges* on each side of the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap*. The *basic limit* for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* is
specified in clauses 6.6.4.2.1 to 6.6.4.2.4 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- f_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a multi-carrier *single-band connector* or a *single-band connector*
configured for intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous *carrier
aggregation* the definitions above apply to the lower edge of the
carrier transmitted at the *lowest carrier* frequency and the upper edge
of the carrier transmitted at the *highest carrier* frequency within a
specified frequency band.

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink *operating
band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\*Δf~OBUE~,
f_offset~max~ shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the outermost edges of the two supported downlink *operating bands* and
the operating band unwanted emission *basic limits* of the band where
there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present
clause, shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission *basic limits*
of the band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the
tables of the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~),
shall apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~
MHz above the highest frequency of the supported downlink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted.

For a multicarrier *single-band connector* or a *single-band connector*
configured for intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous *carrier
aggregation* the definitions above apply to the lower edge of the
carrier transmitted at the *lowest carrier* frequency and the upper edge
of the carrier transmitted at the *highest carrier* frequency within a
specified frequency band.

In addition inside any *sub-block gap* for a *single-band connector*
operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, a combined *basic* limit shall
be applied which is the cumulative sum of the *basic limit*s specified
for the adjacent *sub-blocks* on each side of the *sub-block gap*. The
*basic limit* for each *sub-block* is specified in clauses 6.6.4.2.1 to
6.6.4.2.4 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *sub-block*
edge.

\- f_offset is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f_offset~max~ is equal to the *sub-block gap* bandwidth minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For Wide Area BS, the requirements of either clause 6.6.4.2.1 (Category
A limits) or clause 6.6.4.2.2 (Category B limits) shall apply.

For Medium Range BS, the requirements in clause 6.6.4.2.3 shall apply
(Category A and B).

For Local Area BS, the requirements of clause 6.6.4.2.4 shall apply
(Category A and B).

The requirements shall also apply if the BS supports NB-IoT operation in
NR in-band.

The application of either Category A or Category B *basic limits* shall
be the same as for Transmitter spurious emissions in clause 6.6.5.

#### 6.6.4.2 *Basic limits*

##### 6.6.4.2.1 *Basic limits* for Wide Area BS (Category A)

For BS operating in Bands n5, n8, n12, n13, n14, n18, n26, n28, n29,
n71, n85, n105, *basic limits* are specified in tables 6.6.4.2.1‑1 and
6.6.4.2.1-1a.

##### 6.6.4.2.2 Basic limits for Wide Area BS (Category B)

For Category B Operating band unwanted emissions, there are two options
for the *basic limits* that may be applied regionally. Either the *basic
limits* in clause 6.6.4.2.2.1 or clause 6.6.4.2.2.2 shall be applied.

##### 6.6.4.2.2.1 Category B requirements (Option 1) {#category-b-requirements-option-1 .H6}

For BS operating in Bands n5, n8, n12, n20, n26, n28, n29, n67, n71,
n85, n105, the *basic limits* are specified in tables 6.6.4.2.2.1-1 and
6.6.4.2.2.1-1a.:

##### 6.6.4.2.4A Basic limits for Local Area and Medium Range BS for bands n46, n96 and n102 (Category A and B)

For Local Area and Medium Range BS operating in band n46, basic limits
for 10 MHz channel bandwidth are specified in table 6.6.4.2.4A-1. For
Local Area and Medium Range BS operating in bands n46, n96 and n102,
basic limits for 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 60 MHz, 80 MHz and 100 MHz channel
bandwidth are specified in table 6.6.4.2.4A-2. The nominal bandwidth N =
BW~Channel~ of the transmitted carrier. For one non-transmitted channel
basic limits are specified in table 6.6.4.2.4A-3, and for two
non-transmitted channels basic limits are specified in table
6.6.4.2.4A-4, and for three non-transmitted channels basic limits are
specified in table 6.6.4.2.4A-5.

In the case of one, two or three non-transmitted 20 MHz channels between
transmitted channels, when a NR-U channel bandwidth of 60 MHz, 80 MHz or
100 MHz have been assigned, the spectrum emission mask for
non-transmitted channels specified in Table 6.6.4.2.4A-3,Table
6.6.4.2.4A-4 and Table 6.6.4.2.4A-5 applies for one, two, and three
non-transmitted channels respectively. The spectrum emission mask for
non-transmitted channels apply to frequencies (Δf~BE_offset~) starting
from the edge of the last transmitted channel of the channels assigned
for NR-U channel bandwidth. The relative power of any BS emission shall
not exceed the most stringent levels given by Table 6.6.4.2.4A-3, Table
6.6.4.2.4A-4 and Table 6.6.4.2.4A-5 in the case of non-transmitted
channels between transmitted channels.

In the case of non-transmitted 20 MHz channel(s) on the edges of an
assigned NR-U channel bandwidth the general spectrum emission mask
specified in Table 6.6.4.2.4A-2 is applied to the remaining transmitted
channels to form an additional spectrum emission mask. The additional
spectrum emission mask is applied to the total bandwidth of the
remaining transmitted channels.

The additional spectrum emission mask is floored at:
$P_{\text{rated,x}}\text{-10log10}\left( \frac{\text{B}\text{W}_{\text{Channel}}}{100kHz} \right) - 28dB$.

The relative power of any BS emission shall not exceed the most
stringent levels given by the initial general spectrum emission mask
with full channel bandwidth and the additional spectrum emission mask
with the channel bandwidth of the transmitted channels in the case of
non-transmitted channels at the edge of an assigned NR-U channel
bandwidth.

##### 6.6.4.2.5 *Basic limits* for additional requirements

##### 6.6.4.2.5.1 Limits in FCC Title 47 {#limits-in-fcc-title-47 .H6}

In addition to the requirements in clauses 6.6.4.2.1, 6.6.4.2.2,
6.6.4.2.3 and 6.6.4.2.4, the BS may have to comply with the applicable
emission limits established by FCC Title 47 \[8\], when deployed in
regions where those limits are applied, and under the conditions
declared by the manufacturer.

##### 6.6.4.2.5.2 Protection of DTT {#protection-of-dtt .H6}

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For *BS type 1-C* or *BS type 1-H* operating in Band n20, the level
of emissions in the band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter
bandwidth on centre frequencies F~filter~ according to table
6.6.4.2.5.2-1, a *basic limits* P~EM,N~ is declared by the manufacturer.
This requirement applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though
part of the range falls in the spurious domain.

Note: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions
at the *antenna connector* and the deployment (including antenna gain
and feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the
characteristics of the BS needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement. Compliance with the regional requirement can be determined
using the method outlined in TS 36.104 \[13\], annex F.

##### 6.6.4.2.5.3 Additional operating band unwanted emissions limits for Band n48 {#additional-operating-band-unwanted-emissions-limits-for-band-n48 .H6}

The following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band n48 in
certain regions. Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified
in table 6.6.4.2.5.3-1.

##### 6.6.4.2.5.5 Additional operating band unwanted emissions limits for operation with shared spectrum channel access {#additional-operating-band-unwanted-emissions-limits-for-operation-with-shared-spectrum-channel-access .H6}

In addition, for operation with shared spectrum channel access, the BS
may have to comply with the applicable operating band unwanted emission
limits established regionally, when deployed in regions where those
limits apply and under the conditions declared by the manufacturer. The
regional requirements may be in the form of conducted power, power
spectral density, EIRP and other types of limits. In case of regulatory
limits based on EIRP, assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex
F.2.

##### 6.6.4.2.5.6 Additional operating band unwanted emissions limits for Band n24 {#additional-operating-band-unwanted-emissions-limits-for-band-n24 .H6}

In regions where FCC regulation applies, requirements for protection of
GPS according to FCC Order DA 20-48 applies for operation in Band n24.
The following normative requirement covers the base station, to be used
together with other information about the site installation to verify
compliance with the requirement in FCC Order DA 20-48. The requirement
applies to BS operating in Band n24 to ensure that appropriate
interference protection is provided to the 1541 -- 1650 MHz band. This
requirement applies to the frequency range 1541-1650 MHz, even though
part of this range falls within the spurious domain.

The level of emissions in the 1541 -- 1650 MHz band, measured in
measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.6.4.2.5.6-1 shall not exceed
the maximum emission levels P~EM,B24,a,~ P~EM,B24,b~, P~EM,B24,c~,
P~EM,B24,d~, P~EM,B24,e~ and P~EM,B24,f~ declared by the manufacturer.

Note: The regional requirements in FCC Order DA 20-48 are defined in
terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent
on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment
(including antenna gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is calculated
using: P~EIRP~ = P~E~ + G~ant~ where P~E~ denotes the BS unwanted
emission level at the antenna connector, G~ant~ equals the BS antenna
gain minus feeder loss. The requirement defined above provides the
characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the
regional requirement.

The operating band unwanted emissions for *BS type 1-C* for each
*antenna connector* shall be below the applicable *basic limits* defined
in clause 6.6.4.2.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the operating band unwanted
emissions limits shall be applied to the sum of the emission power over
all *antenna connectors* for *BS type 1-C.*

#### 6.6.4.4 Minimum requirements for *BS type 1-H*

The operating band unwanted emissions requirements for *BS type 1-H* are
that for each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and each applicable
*basic limit* in clause 6.6.4.2, the power summation emissions at the
*TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall not
exceed a BS limit specified as the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).

NOTE: Conformance to the *BS type 1-H* spurious emission requirement can
be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to the
limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the *BS type 1-H* limit as defined in this clause for
the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(n), where n is the
number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

### 6.6.5 Transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.6.5.1 General

The transmitter spurious emission limits shall apply from 9 kHz to
12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, up to Δf~OBUE~
above the highest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*,
where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.6.1-1. For some *operating
bands*, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with
the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the downlink *operating band*, as specified
in ITU-R recommendation SM.329 \[2\].

For a *multi-band connector*, for each supported *operating band*
together with Δf~OBUE~ around the band is excluded from the transmitter
spurious emissions requirement.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

The requirements shall also apply if the BS supports NB-IoT operation in
NR in-band.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

#### 6.6.5.2 *Basic limits*

##### 6.6.5.2.1 General transmitter spurious emissions requirements

The *basic limits* of either table 6.6.5.2.1-1 (Category A limits) or
table 6.6.5. 2.1-2 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for
operating band unwanted emissions in clause 6.6.4.

##### 6.6.5.2.2 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS

This requirement shall be applied for NR FDD operation in order to
prevent the receivers of the BSs being desensitised by emissions from a
BS transmitter. It is measured at the transmit *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* or at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H* for any type
of BS which has common or separate Tx/Rx *antenna* *connectors* / *TAB
connectors*.

The spurious emission *basic limits* are provided in table 6.6.5.2.2-1.

of the BS receiver

##### 6.6.5.2.3 Additional spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in frequency ranges other than the BS downlink *operating band*. The
limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are
deployed in the same geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by
local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR
*operating band*. It is in some cases not stated in the present document
whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances
that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation.
An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in
clause 4.5.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.

The spurious emission *basic limits* are provided in table 6.6.5.2.3 -1
for a BS where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in
the first column apply. For a *multi-band connector*, the exclusions and
conditions in the Note column of table 6.6.5.2.3 -1 apply for each
supported *operating band*.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS
operating in Band n28, the co-existence requirements in table 6.6.5.2.3
-1 do not apply for the Δf~OBUE~ frequency range immediately outside the
downlink *operating band* (see table 5.2-1). Emission limits for this
excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional
requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.5.2.3 -1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where the
frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed
in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that
are synchronized and use the same or adjacent *operating bands* can
transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For
unsynchronized base stations, special co-existence requirements may
apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 4: For NR Band n28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil
the spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with E-UTRA Band
27 UL *operating band*.

NOTE 5: For NR Band n29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil
the spurious emissions limits for NR BS for co-existence with UTRA Band
XII, E-UTRA Band 12 or NR Band n12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL
operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL or NR Band n85 UL operating band.

The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink
*operating band* and Δf~OBUE~ above the highest BS transmitter frequency
of the downlink *operating band*. Δf~OBUE~ is defined in clause 6.6.1.

The spurious emission *basic limit* for this requirement is:

NOTE 1: The resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be
equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be
smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated
over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise
bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE 2: The regional requirement, included in \[12\], is defined in
terms of EIRP, which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the
*antenna connector* and the deployment (including antenna gain and
feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics
of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement. The assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex F.

The following requirement shall be applied to BS operating in Band n26
to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 800
MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the
frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS
downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the
BS downlink operating band.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

Note: The regional requirements is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions
at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and
feeder loss). The EIRP level is calculated using: P~EIRP~ = P~E~ +
G~ant~ where P~E~ denotes the BS unwanted emission level at the antenna
connector, G~ant~ equals the BS antenna gain minus feeder loss. The
requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base
station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement
specified in attachment to the FCC reference document, 0007135419.

##### 6.6.5.2.4 Co-location with other base stations

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA
TDD, E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.

The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and
receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same
class.

The *basic limits* are in table 6.6.5.2.4-1 for a BS where requirements
for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply,
depending on the declared Base Station class. For a *multi-band
connector*, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table
6.6.5.2.4-1 shall apply for each supported *operating band*.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in table 6.6.5.2.4-1 do not apply for the
frequency range extending Δf~OBUE~ immediately outside the BS transmit
frequency range of a downlink *operating band* (see table 5.2-1). The
current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic
solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for
30dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain
site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are
addressed in TR 25.942 \[4\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.5.2.4-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in table 5.2-1
would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area.
For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in
the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply
that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the
same or adjacent *operating band* can transmit without special
co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

#### 6.6.5.3 Minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C*

The Tx spurious emissions for *BS type 1-C* for each *antenna connector*
shall not exceed the *basic limits* specified in clause 6.6.5.2.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of the spurious
emissions over all *antenna connectors* for *BS type 1-C* shall not
exceed the *basic limits* defined in clause 6.6.5.2.

#### 6.6.5.4 Minimum requirements for *BS type 1-H*

The Tx spurious emissions requirements for *BS type 1-H* are that for
each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and each applicable *basic limit*
in clause 6.6.5.2, the power summation emissions at the *TAB connectors*
of the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall
not exceed a limit specified as the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~), unless stated differently in regional
regulation.

NOTE: Conformance to the *BS type 1-H* spurious emission requirement can
be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to the
limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the *BS type 1-H* limit as defined in this clause for
the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(n), where n is the
number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

## 6.7 Transmitter intermodulation

### 6.7.1 General

The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals
in its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the antenna, RDN
and antenna array. The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter
ON period* and the *transmitter transient period*.

For *BS type 1-C*, the transmitter intermodulation level is the power of
the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into
the *antenna connector*.

For *BS type 1-H*, the transmitter intermodulation level is the power of
the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into
the *TAB connector*.

For *BS type 1-H*, there are two types of transmitter intermodulation
cases captured by the transmitter intermodulation requirement:

1\) Co-location transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering
signal is from a co-located base station.

2\) Intra-system transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering
signal is from other transmitter units within the *BS type 1-H*.

For *BS type 1-H*, the co-location transmitter intermodulation
requirement is considered sufficient if the interference signal for the
co-location requirement is higher than the declared interference signal
for intra-system transmitter intermodulation requirement.

### 6.7.2 Minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C*

#### 6.7.2.1 Co-location minimum requirements

For *BS type 1-C*, the wanted signal and interfering signal centre
frequency is specified in table 6.7.2.1‑1, where interfering signal
level is *Rated total output power* (P~rated,t,AC~) at *antenna
connector* in the *operating band* -- 30 dB.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For a BS operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the requirement is also
applicable inside a *sub-block gap* for interfering signal offsets where
the interfering signal falls completely within the *sub-block gap*. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges.

For a *multi-band connector*, the requirement shall apply relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* of each supported *operating
band*. In case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* is less than 3\*BW~Channel~
(where BW~Channel~ is the minimal *BS channel bandwidth* of the band),
the requirement in the gap shall apply only for interfering signal
offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the *Inter
RF Bandwidth gap*.

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted
emission limits in clauses 6.6.3, 6.6.4 and 6.6.5 in the presence of an
NR interfering signal according to table 6.7.2.1-1.

#  7 Conducted receiver characteristics

## 7.1 General

Conducted receiver characteristics are specified at the *antenna
connector* for *BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type
1-H*, with full complement of transceivers for the configuration in
normal operating condition.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for conducted
receiver characteristics requirements in clause 7:

\- Requirements apply during the BS receive period.

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- For FDD operation the requirements shall be met with the transmitter
unit(s) ON.

\- Throughput requirements defined for the radiated receiver
characteristics do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- When BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

\- For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative
offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the lower *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block gap*,
and the positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the
upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a
*sub-block gap*.

\- Requirements shall also apply for BS supporting NB-IoT operation in
NR in-band. The corresponding NB-IoT requirements are specified in TS
36.104 \[13\] clause 7.

NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the BS in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time.

NOTE 2: In normal operating condition the BS in TDD operation is
configured to TX OFF power during *receive period*.

For BS *type 1-H* there is no requirement specified for band n46 and
n102.

## 7.2 Reference sensitivity level

### 7.2.1 General

The reference sensitivity power level P~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean
power received at the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB
connector* for *BS type 1-H* at which a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel.

### 7.2.2 Minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters specified
in table 7.2.2-1 for Wide Area BS, in table 7.2.2-2 for Medium Range BS
and in table 7.2.2-3 for Local Area BS in any operating band except for
band n46, n96, n102 and n104.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters specified
in table 7.2.2-2a for Medium Range BS and in table 7.2.2-3a for Local
Area BS, for band n46 and n102.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters specified
in table 7.2.2-2b for Medium Range BS and in table 7.2.2-3b for Local
Area BS, for band n96.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters specified
in table 7.2.2-1a for Wide Area BS, in table 7.2.2-2c for Medium Range
BS and in table 7.2.2-3c for Local Area BS for band n104.

## 7.3 Dynamic range

### 7.3.1 General

The dynamic range is specified as a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering
signal at the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector*
for *BS type 1-H* inside the received *BS channel bandwidth*. In this
condition, a throughput requirement shall be met for a specified
reference measurement channel. The interfering signal for the dynamic
range requirement is an AWGN signal.

### 7.3.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters specified
in table 7.3.2-1 for Wide Area BS, in table 7.3.2-2 for Medium Range BS
and in table 7.3.2-3 for Local Area BS in any operating band except for
band n46, n96, n102 and n104.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters specified
in table 7.3.2-2b for Medium Range BS and in table 7.3.2-3b for Local
Area BS, for band n46.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters specified
in table 7.3.2-2c for Medium Range BS and in table 7.3.2-3c for Local
Area BS, for band n96 and n102.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters specified
in table 7.3.2-1b for Wide Area BS, in table 7.3.2-2d for Medium Range
BS and in table 7.3.2-3d for Local Area BS in band n104.

For NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in
Annex A of TS 36.104 \[13\] with parameters specified in table 7.3.2-1a
for Wide Area BS, in table 7.3.2-2a for Medium Range BS and in table
7.3.2-3a for Local Area BS.

## 7.4 In-band selectivity and blocking

### 7.4.1 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)

#### 7.4.1.1 General

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency at
the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS
type 1-H* in the presence of an adjacent channel signal with a specified
centre frequency offset of the interfering signal to the band edge of a
victim system.

#### 7.4.1.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For BS operating except for band n46, n96, n102 and n104, the wanted and
the interfering signal coupled to the *BS* *type 1-C* *antenna
connector* or *BS type 1-H* *TAB connector* are specified in table
7.4.1.2-1 and the frequency offset between the wanted and interfering
signal in table 7.4.1.2-2 for ACS. The reference measurement channel for
the wanted signal is identified in table 7.2.2-1, 7.2.2-2 and 7.2.2-3
for each *BS channel bandwidth* in any operating band except for band
n46, n96, n102 and n104 and further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
D.

For BS operating in band n46, n96 and n102, the wanted and the
interfering signal coupled to the BS type 1-C antenna connector or BS
type 1-H TAB connector are specified in table 7.4.1.2-1a and the
frequency offset between the wanted and interfering signal in table
7.4.1.2-2a for ACS. The reference measurement channel for the wanted
signal is identified in table 7.2.2-2a and 7.2.2-3a for each *BS channel
bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1a. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex D.

For BS operating in band n104, the wanted and the interfering signal
coupled to the BS type 1-C antenna connector or BS type 1-H TAB
connector are specified in table 7.4.1.2-1b and the frequency offset
between the wanted and interfering signal in table 7.4.1.2-2 for ACS.
The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
7.2.2-1a, 7.2.2-2c, 7.2.2-3c for each *BS channel bandwidth* and further
specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is
further specified in annex D.

For BS supporting NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, the wanted and the
interfering signal coupled to the *BS* *type 1-C* *antenna connector*
are specified in table 7.4.1.2-1 and the frequency offset between the
wanted and interfering signal in table 7.4.1.2-2 for ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the NB-IoT wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.2.1 of TS 36.104 \[13\]. The characteristics of the interfering
signal is further specified in annex D.

The ACS requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *Base station RF Bandwidth* edges or *Radio
Bandwidth* edges.

For a BS operating in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any *operating
band*, the ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside any *sub-block
gap*, in case the *sub-block gap size* is at least as wide as the NR
interfering signal in table 7.4.1.2-2. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACS requirement shall apply in
addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in
table 7.4.1.2‑2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap*.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H.*

### 7.4.2 In-band blocking

#### 7.4.2.1 General

The in-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the
*antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS type
1-H* in the presence of an unwanted interferer, which is an NR signal
for general blocking or an NR signal with one resource block for
narrowband blocking.

#### 7.4.2.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*BS type 1-C* *antenna connector* or *BS type 1‑H* *TAB connector* using
the parameters in tables 7.4.2.2-1, 7.4.2.2-2 and 7.4.2.2-3 for general
blocking and narrowband blocking requirements. Narrowband blocking
requirements are not applied for band n46, n96, n102 and n104. The
reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.2.2 for each *BS channel bandwidth* and further specified in
annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex D.

For NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted
and an interfering signal coupled to *BS type 1-C* *antenna connector*
using the parameters in tables 7.4.2.2-1, 7.4.2.2-2a and 7.4.2.2-3 for
general blocking and narrowband blocking requirements. The reference
measurement channel for the NB-IoT wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.2.1 of TS 36.104 \[13\]. The characteristics of the interfering
signal is further specified in annex D.

The in-band blocking requirements apply outside the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio
Bandwidth* edges.

The in-band blocking requirement shall apply from F~UL,low~ - Δf~OOB~ to
F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~, excluding the downlink frequency range of the FDD
*operating band*. The Δf~OOB~ for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* is
defined in table 7.4.2.2-0.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H.*

For a BS operating in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any *operating
band*, the in-band blocking requirements apply in addition inside any
*sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as wide as
twice the interfering signal minimum offset in tables 7.4.2.2-1. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges
inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the blocking requirements apply in the
in-band blocking frequency ranges for each supported *operating band*.
The requirement shall apply in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as
twice the interfering signal minimum offset in tables 7.4.2.2-1.

For a BS operating in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any *operating
band*, the narrowband blocking requirement shall apply in addition
inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap size* is at least
as wide as the *channel bandwidth* of the NR interfering signal in Table
7.4.2.2-3. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the narrowband blocking requirement shall
apply in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as the NR interfering
signal in Table 7.4.2.2-3. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* edges inside the *Inter RF

## 7.5 Out-of-band blocking

### 7.5.1 General

The out-of-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the
*antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS type
1-H* in the presence of an unwanted interferer out of the *operating
band*, which is a CW signal for out-of-band blocking.

### 7.5.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

Except for band n46, n96, n102 and n104, the throughput shall be ≥ 95%
of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a
wanted and an interfering signal coupled to *BS type 1-C* *antenna
connector* or *BS type 1-H* *TAB connector* using the parameters in
table 7.5.2-1.

For band n46, n96 and n102, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted and an
interfering signal coupled to BS type 1-C antenna connector or BS type
1-H TAB connector using the parameters in table 7.5.2-1a.

For *BS type 1-C* operating in band n104, the throughput shall be ≥ 95%
of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a
wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS type 1-C antenna
connector using the parameters in table 7.5.2-1a.

For *BS type 1-H* operating in band n104, the throughput shall be ≥ 95%
of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a
wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS type 1-H TAB connector
using the parameters in table 7.5.2-1.

The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.2.2 for each *BS channel bandwidth* and further specified in
annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex D.

For NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted
and an interfering signal coupled to *BS type 1-C* *antenna connector*
using the parameters in table 7.5.2-1. The reference measurement channel
for the NB-IoT wanted signal is identified in clause 7.2.1 of TS 36.104
\[13\].

The out-of-band blocking requirement apply from 1 MHz to F~UL,low~ -
Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750 MHz, including the
downlink frequency range of the FDD *operating band* for BS supporting
FDD. The Δf~OOB~ for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* is defined in table
7.4.2.2-0.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H.*

For a *multi-band connector*, the requirement in the out-of-band
blocking frequency ranges apply for each *operating band*, with the
exception that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all supported
*operating bands* according to clause 7.4.2.2 shall be excluded from the
out-of-band blocking requirement.

### 7.5.3 Co-location minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of NR BS receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA or NR BS operating in a
different frequency band are co-located with a NR BS. The requirement is
applicable to all *BS channel bandwidths* supported by the NR BS.

The requirements in this clause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
interfering transmitter and NR BS receiver and are based on co-location
with base stations of the same class.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*BS type 1-C* *antenna connector* or *BS type 1-H* *TAB connector* input
using the parameters in table 7.5.3-1 for all the BS classes. The
reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
tables 7.2.2-1, 7.2.2-2 and 7.2.2-3 for each *BS channel bandwidth* and
further specified in annex A.1.

The blocking requirement for co-location with BS in other bands is
applied for all *operating bands* for which co-location protection is
provided.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H.*

Table 7.5.3-1: Blocking performance requirement for NR BS when
co-located with BS in other frequency bands.

### 7.5.5 Additional out-of-band blocking requirements for the use of RMR bands

For the additional out-of-band blocking requirements, the interfering
signal differs from the one used for the general out-of-band blocking
requirement.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*BS type 1-C* *antenna connector* using the parameters in table 7.5.5-1.
The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.2.2 for each *BS channel bandwidth* and further specified in
annex A.1.

The following requirement may apply to BS operating in band n101 in
certain regions.

## 7.6 Receiver spurious emissions

### 7.6.1 General

The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions
generated or amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the *antenna
connector* (for *BS type 1-C*) or at the *TAB connector* (for *BS type
1-H*). The requirements apply to all BS with separate RX and TX *antenna
connectors* / *TAB connectors*.

NOTE: In this case for FDD operation the test is performed when both TX
and RX are ON, with the TX *antenna connectors* / *TAB connectors*
terminated.

For a*ntenna connectors* / *TAB connectors* supporting both RX and TX in
TDD, the requirements apply during the *transmitter OFF period*. For
*antenna connectors* / *TAB connectors* supporting both RX and TX in
FDD, the RX spurious emissions requirements are superseded by the TX
spurious emissions requirements, as specified in clause 6.6.5.

For RX-only *multi-band* *connectors*, the spurious emissions
requirements are subject to exclusion zones in each supported *operating
band*. For *multi-band* *connectors* that both transmit and receive in
*operating band* supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are
applicable during the *TX OFF period*, and are subject to exclusion
zones in each supported *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* manufacturer shall declare *TAB connector RX min cell
groups*. Every *TAB connector* of *BS type 1‑H* supporting reception in
an *operating band* shall map to one *TAB connector RX min cell group*,
where mapping of *TAB connectors* to cells/beams is implementation
dependent.

The number of active receiver units that are considered when calculating
the conducted RX spurious emission limits (N~RXU,counted~) for *BS type
1-H* is calculated as follows:

N~RXU,counted~ = *min(N~RXU,active~ , 8* *× N~cells~)*

N~RXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of *basic limits* and is
derived as N~RXU,countedpercell~ = N~RXU,counted~ / N~cells~, where
N~cells~ is defined in clause 6.1.

NOTE: N~RXU,active~ is the number of actually active receiver units and
is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

### 7.6.2 *Basic limits*

The receiver spurious emissions *basic limits* are provided in table
7.6.2-1.

### 7.6.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C*

The RX spurious emissions requirements for *BS type 1-C* are that for
each *antenna connector,* the power of emissions shall not exceed *basic
limits* specified in table 7.6.2-1.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of RX spurious
emissions requirements over all *antenna connectors* for *BS type 1-C*
shall not exceed *basic limits* specified in table 7.6.2-1.

The Rx spurious emissions requirements shall apply to BS that support NR
or NR with NB-IoT operation in NR in-band.

### 7.6.4 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H*

The RX spurious emissions requirements for *BS type 1-H* are that for
each applicable *basic limit* specified in table 7.6.2-1 for each *TAB
connector RX min cell group,* the power sum of emissions at respective
*TAB connectors* shall not exceed the BS limits specified as the *basic
limit*s + X, where X = 10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~), unless stated
differently in regional regulation.

The RX spurious emission requirements are applied per the *TAB connector
RX min cell group* for all the configurations supported by the BS.

NOTE: Conformance to the BS receiver spurious emissions requirement can
be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the spurious emissions power measured on each *TAB
connector* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group* shall be less than
or equal to the BS limit above for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The spurious emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the BS limit as defined above for the respective
frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(*n*), where *n* is the number of
*TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group*.

## 7.7 Receiver intermodulation

### 7.7.1 General

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency at
the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS
type 1-H* in the presence of two interfering signals which have a
specific frequency relationship to the wanted signal.

### 7.7.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two interfering signals coupled to the *BS type 1-C
antenna connector* or *BS type 1-H* *TAB connector*, with the conditions
specified in tables 7.7.2-1 and 7.7.2-2 for intermodulation performance
in any operating band except for band n46, n96 and n102, and 7.7.2-2a
for band n46, n96 and n102 and in tables 7.7.2-3, and 7.7.2-4 for
narrowband intermodulation performance. Narrowband intermodulation
requirements are not applied for band n46, n96, n102 and n104. The
reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
tables 7.2.2-1, 7.2.2-2 and 7.2.2-3 for each *BS channel bandwidth* and
further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering
signal is further specified in annex D.

For NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted
signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering signals
coupled to the *BS type 1-C antenna connector*, with the conditions
specified in tables 7.7.2-1 and 7.7.2-2 for intermodulation performance
and in tables 7.7.2-3, and 7.7.2-4 for narrowband intermodulation
performance. The reference measurement channel for the NB-IoT wanted
signal is identified in clause 7.2.1 of TS 36.104 \[13\]. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
D.

The subcarrier spacing for the modulated interfering signal shall in
general be the same as the subcarrier spacing for the wanted signal,
except for the case of wanted signal subcarrier spacing 60 kHz and *BS
channel bandwidth* \<=20MHz, for which the subcarrier spacing of the
interfering signal shall be 30 kHz.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth edges*. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* or
*Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For a BS operating in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any *operating
band*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement shall apply in
addition inside any *sub-block gap* in case the *sub-block gap* is at
least as wide as the *channel bandwidth* of the NR interfering signal in
table 7.7.2-2 or 7.7.2-4. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the intermodulation requirement shall
apply in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the gap
size is at least twice as wide as the NR interfering signal centre
frequency offset from the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement
shall apply in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* in case the
gap size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in tables
7.7.2-2 and 7.7.2-4. The interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap*.

### 7.7.3 Additional narrowband intermodulation requirement for Band n100

The following requirement shall apply to BS operating in Band n100 in
CEPT countries. The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the
assigned channel frequency and two interfering signals coupled to the
*BS type 1-C antenna connector* operating in Band n100, with the
conditions specified in tables 7.7.3-1 and 7.7.3-2 for narrowband
intermodulation performance. The reference measurement channel for the
wanted signal is identified in table 7.2.2-1 and further specified in
annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex D.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*.

## 7.8 In-channel selectivity

### 7.8.1 General

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations at the
*antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS type
1-H* in the presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power
spectral density. In this condition a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel. The interfering
signal shall be an NR signal which is time aligned with the wanted
signal.

### 7.8.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

For *BS type 1-C* and *BS type* *1-H*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified
in annex A.1 with parameters specified in table 7.8.2-1 for Wide Area BS
except for band n104, in table 7.8.2-1b for Wide Area BS for band n104,
in table 7.8.2-2 for Medium Range BS except for band n46, n96, n102 and
n104, in table 7.8.2-2b for Medium Range BS for band n46, in table
7.8.2-2c for Medium Range BS for band n96 and n102, in table 7.8.2-2d
for Medium Range BS for band n104, in table 7.8.2-3 for Local Area BS
except for band n46, n96, n102 and n104, in table 7.8.2-3b for Local
Area BS for band n46, in table 7.8.2-3c for Local Area BS for band n96
and n102 and in table 7.8.2-3d for Local Area BS. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex D.

For NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the NB-IoT reference measurement channel as
specified in Annex A of TS 36.104 \[13\] with parameters specified in
table 7.8.2-1a for Wide Area BS, in table 7.8.2-2a for Medium Range BS
and in table 7.8.2-3a for Local Area BS.

#  8 Conducted performance requirements

## 8.1 General

### 8.1.1 Scope and definitions

Conducted performance requirements specify the ability of the *BS type
1-C* or *BS type 1-H* to correctly demodulate signals in various
conditions and configurations. Conducted performance requirements are
specified at the *antenna connector(s)* (for *BS type 1-C*) and at the
*TAB connector(s)* (for *BS type 1-H*).

Conducted performance requirements for the BS are specified for the
fixed reference channels defined in annex A and the propagation
conditions in annex G. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that
are supported by the base station.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Performance requirements for a BS supporting *carrier
aggregation* are defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

For FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall be met with the
transmitter units associated with *antenna connectors* (for *BS type
1-C*) or *TAB connectors* (for *BS type 1-H*) in the *operating* *band*
turned ON.

NOTE: In normal operating conditions, *antenna connector*s (for *BS type
1-C*) or *TAB connectors* (for *BS type 1-H*) in FDD operation are
configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The associated
transmitter unit(s) may be OFF for some of the tests as specified in TS
38.141-1 \[5\].

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in the slot on a single *antenna connector*
(for *BS type 1-C*) or on a single *TAB connector* (for *BS type 1-H*).

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the *transmission
bandwidth* over the same duration where signal energy exists on a single
*antenna connector* (for *BS type 1-C*) or on a single *TAB connector*
(for *BS type 1-H*).

## 8.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH

### 8.2.1 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

#### 8.2.1.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

### 8.2.2 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

#### 8.2.2.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

### 8.2.3 Requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH

#### 8.2.3.1 General

In the tests for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH, the UCI information only
contains CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information, and there is no HACK/ACK
information transmitted.

The CSI part 1 block error probability (BLER) is defined as the
probability of incorrectly decoding the CSI part 1 information when the
CSI part 1 information is sent as follow:

${BLER}_{CSI\ part\ 1} = \ \frac{\#(false\ CSI\ part\ 1)}{\#(CSI\ part\ 1)}$

where:

\- #(false CSI part 1) denotes the number of incorrectly decoded CSI
part 1 information transmitted occasions

\- #(CSI part 1) denotes the number of CSI part 1 information
transmitted occasions.

The CSI part 2 block error probability is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the CSI part 2 information when the CSI part 2
information is sent as follows:

${BLER}_{CSI\ part\ 2} = \ \frac{\#(false\ CSI\ part\ 2)}{\#(CSI\ part\ 2)}$

where:

\- #(false CSI part 2) denotes the number of incorrectly decoded CSI
part 2 information transmitted occasions

\- #(CSI part 2) denotes the number of CSI part 2 information
transmitted occasions.

The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined for two
cases as follows:

\- 5 bits in CSI part 1, 2 bits in CSI part 2

\- 20 bits in CSI part 1, 20 bits in CSI part 2

The 7bits UCI case is further defined with the bitmap \[c0 c1 c2 c3 c4\]
= \[0 1 0 1 0\] for CSI part 1 information, where c0 is mapping to the
RI information, and with the bitmap \[c0 c1\] = \[1 0\] for CSI part2
information.

The 40bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit
selection.

In both tests, PUSCH data, CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information are
transmitted simultaneously.

### 8.2.4 Requirements for PUSCH for high speed train

#### 8.2.4.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions. The performance
requirements for high speed train are optional.

The performance requirements for PUSCH for high speed train only apply
to Wide Area Base Stations and Medium Range Base Stations (subject to
declaration).

### 8.2.5 Requirements for UL timing adjustment

The performance requirement of UL timing adjustment is determined by a
minimum required throughput for the moving The performance requirement
of UL timing adjustment is determined by a minimum required throughput
for the moving UE at given SNR. The performance requirements assume HARQ
retransmissions. The performance requirements for UL timing adjustment
scenario Y and scenario Z defined in Annex G.4 are optional.

In the tests for UL timing adjustment, two signals are configured, one
being transmitted by a moving UE and the other being transmitted by a
stationary UE. The transmission of SRS from UE is optional. FRC
parameters in Table A.4-2B are applied for both UEs. The received power
for both UEs is the same. The resource blocks allocated for both UEs are
consecutive. In scenario Y and scenario Z Doppler shift is not taken
into account.

### 8.2.6 Requirements for PUSCH 0.001% BLER

#### 8.2.6.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a maximum required
transport block error rate (BLER) for a given SNR. The required BLER is
defined as the probability of incorrectly decoding the transport block
after reaching the maximum number of HARQ transmissions for the FRCs
listed in annex A.

### 8.2.7 Requirements for PUSCH repetition Type A

#### 8.2.7.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a maximum block
error probability (BLER) for a given SNR. The BLER is defined as the
probability of incorrectly decoding the PUSCH information when the PUSCH
information is sent. The performance requirements assume HARQ
re-transmissions.

### 8.2.8 Requirements for PUSCH mapping Type B with non-slot transmission

#### 8.2.8.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

### 8.2.9 Requirements of PUSCH for 2-step RA type

#### 8.2.9.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH for 2-step RA type is determined by
a minimum required block error rate of MsgA received by BS at given SNR
for the FRCs listed in Annex A. The performance requirements assume that
the precedent preamble of MsgA is correctly detected in a 2-step RA type
procedure, and no HARQ retransmissions.

The performance requirements are applicable for wide area and medium
range BS that support 2-step RA type.

The performance requirements are not applied for a local area BS that
supports 2-step RA type.

### 8.2.10 Requirements for interlaced PUSCH

#### 8.2.10.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH with interlace allocation is
determined by a minimum required throughput for a given SNR. The
required throughput is expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for
the FRCs listed in annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ
retransmissions.

### 8.2.11 Performance requirements for CG-UCI multiplexed on interlaced PUSCH

#### 8.2.11.1 General

The performance requirement of CG-UCI multiplexed on interlaced PUSCH is
determined by the parameter: block error probability (BLER) of CG-UCI.
The performance is measured by the required SNR at block error
probability of CG-UCI not exceeding 1%.

The CG-UCI BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly decoding
the CG-UCI information when the CG-UCI information is sent.

In the test of UCI multiplexed on interlaced PUSCH, the UCI information
only contains CG-UCI information, there is no HACK/ACK, CSI part 1 or
CSI part 2 information transmitted.

The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined as 18
bits.

The 18 bits UCI information case is further defined with the bitmap \[c0
c1 c2 c3 c4 ... c17\] for CG-UCI information, where

\- \[c0 c1 c2 c3\] = \[0 0 0 1\] is mapping to the HARQ process number
information,

\- \[c4 c5\] = \[0 0\] is mapping to the RV sequence information.

\- \[c6\] = \[1\] is mapping to the NDI information.

\- \[c7 c8 ... c17\] = \[0 0 ... 0\] is the COT sharing information
field.

In the test, PUSCH data and CG-UCI are transmitted simultaneously.

Which specific test(s) is applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rule defined in clause 8.1.2.

### 8.2.12 Requirements for TB processing over multi-slot PUSCH (TBoMS)

#### 8.2.12.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH TBoMS is determined by a minimum
required throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is
expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in
annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

### 8.2.13 Requirements for PUSCH with DM-RS bundling

#### 8.2.13.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

## 8.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH

### 8.3.1 DTX to ACK probability

#### 8.3.1.1 General

The DTX to ACK probability, i.e. the probability that ACK is detected
when nothing was sent:

$Prob(PUCCH\ DTX \rightarrow Ack\ bits) = \ \frac{\#(false\ ACK\ bits)}{\#(PUCCH\ DTX)*\#(ACK/NACK\ bits)}$

where:

\- #(false ACK bits) denotes the number of detected ACK bits.

\- #(ACK/NACK bits) denotes the number of encoded bits per slot

\- #(PUCCH DTX) denotes the number of DTX occasions

#### 8.3.1.2 Minimum requirement

The DTX to ACK probability shall not exceed 1% for all PUCCH formats
carrying ACK/NACK bits:

$Prob(PUCCH\ DTX \rightarrow Ack\ bits)\  \leq \ 10^{- 2}$

### 8.3.2 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 0

#### 8.3.2.1 General

The ACK missed detection probability is the probability of not detecting
an ACK when an ACK was sent.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[17\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC centre, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

### 8.3.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1

#### 8.3.3.1 NACK to ACK requirements

##### 8.3.3.1.1 General

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability that an ACK bit
is falsely detected when an NACK bit was sent on the particular bit
position, where the NACK to ACK detection probability is defined as
follows:

![](./38104/media/image27.wmf){width="4.173611111111111in"
height="0.3888888888888889in"},

where:

\- ![](./38104/media/image28.wmf){width="1.1805555555555556in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}denotes the total number of NACK bits
transmitted

\- ![](./38104/media/image29.wmf){width="2.048611111111111in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}denotes the number of NACK bits decoded
as ACK bits at the receiver, i.e. the number of received ACK bits

\- NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are
mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be
considered.

Random codeword selection is assumed.

#### 8.3.4.2 UCI BLER performance requirements

##### 8.3.4.2.1 General

The UCI block error probability (BLER) is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI information is
sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[17\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC centre, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

The UCI block error probability performance requirement only applies to
the PUCCH format 2 with 22 UCI bits.

### 8.3.5 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 3

#### 8.3.5.1 General

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[17\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the centre, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping
is enabled.

### 8.3.10 Performance requirements for interlaced PUCCH format 2

#### 8.3.10.1 General

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability (BLER) is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI information is
sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The UCI block error probability performance requirement only applies to
the PUCCH format 2 with 22 UCI bits.

The 22bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit
selection.

### 8.3.12 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1 with DM-RS bundling

#### 8.3.12.1 NACK to ACK requirements

##### 8.3.12.1.1 General

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability that an ACK bit
is falsely detected when an NACK bit was sent on the particular bit
position, where the NACK to ACK detection probability is defined as
follows:

![](./38104/media/image27.wmf){width="4.173611111111111in"
height="0.3909722222222222in"},

where:

\- ![](./38104/media/image28.wmf){width="1.1784722222222221in"
height="0.2076388888888889in"}denotes the total number of NACK bits
transmitted

\- ![](./38104/media/image29.wmf){width="2.0493055555555557in"
height="0.2076388888888889in"}denotes the number of NACK bits decoded as
ACK bits at the receiver, i.e. the number of received ACK bits

\- NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are
mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be
considered.

The NACK to ACK detection probability performance requirement only apply
to PUCCH format 1 with 2 UCI bits. The UCI information only contain
ACK/NACK information.

The 2bits UCI information is further defined with bitmap as \[0 1\].

### 8.3.13 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 3 with DMRS bundling

#### 8.3.13.1 General

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

## 8.4 Performance requirements for PRACH

### 8.4.1 PRACH False alarm probability

#### 8.4.1.1 General

The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas,
for any channel bandwidth.

The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of
erroneous detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any
detector) when input is only noise.

#### 8.4.1.2 Minimum requirement

The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.

### 8.4.2 PRACH detection requirements

#### 8.4.2.1 General

The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several
error cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent,
not detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with
the wrong timing estimation. For AWGN, TDLC300-100 and TDLA30-10, a
timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of
the strongest path is larger than the time error tolerance given in
Table 8.4.2.1-1.

The performance requirements for high speed train (table 8.4.23-1 to
8.4.2.3-4) are optional.

#  9 Radiated transmitter characteristics

## 9.1 General

Radiated transmitter characteristics requirements apply on the *BS type
1-H*, *BS type 1-O*, or *BS type 2-O* including all its functional
components active and for all foreseen modes of operation of the BS
unless otherwise stated.

## 9.2 Radiated transmit power

### 9.2.1 General

*BS type 1-H, BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* are declared to support one
or more beams, as per manufacturer\'s declarations specified in TS
38.141-2 \[6\]. Radiated transmit power is defined as the EIRP level for
a declared beam at a specific *beam peak direction*.

For each beam, the requirement is based on declaration of a beam
identity, *reference beam direction pair*, beamwidth, *rated beam EIRP*,
*OTA peak directions set*, the *beam direction pairs* at the maximum
steering directions and their associated *rated beam EIRP* and
beamwidth(s).

For a declared beam and *beam direction pair*, the *rated beam EIRP*
level is the maximum power that the base station is declared to radiate
at the associated *beam peak direction* during the *transmitter ON
period*.

For each *beam peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair*
within the *OTA peak directions set*, a specific *rated beam EIRP* level
may be claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy
requirement as described below. *Rated beam EIRP* is only required to be
declared for the *beam direction pairs* subject to conformance testing
as detailed in TS 38.141-2 \[6\].

NOTE 1: *OTA peak directions set* is set of *beam peak directions* for
which the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met. The *beam
peak directions* are related to a corresponding contiguous range or
discrete list of *beam centre directions* by the *beam direction pairs*
included in the set.

NOTE 2: A *beam direction pair* is data set consisting of the *beam
centre direction* and the related *beam peak direction.*

NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer
for verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the
manufacturer to the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment
and is not subject to formal conformance testing.

For *operating bands* where the supported *fractional bandwidth* (FBW)
is larger than 6%, two rated carrier EIRP may be declared by
manufacturer:

\- P~rated,c,FBWlow~ for lower supported frequency range, and

\- P~rated,c,FBWhigh~ for higher supported frequency range.

For frequencies in between F~FBWlow~ and F~FBWhigh~ the rated carrier

## 9.3 OTA base station output power

### 9.3.1 General

OTA BS output power is declared as the TRP radiated requirement, with
the output power accuracy requirement defined at the RIB during the
*transmitter ON period*. TRP does not change with beamforming settings
as long as the *beam peak direction* is within the *OTA peak directions
set*. Thus the TRP accuracy requirement must be met for any beamforming
setting for which the *beam peak direction* is within the *OTA peak
directions set*.

The BS *rated carrier TRP output power* for *BS type 1-O* shall be
within limits as specified in table 9.3.1-1.

This requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
*operating band*.

#### 9.4.2.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

The OTA RE power control dynamic range is specified the same as the
conducted RE power control dynamic range requirement for *BS type 1-C*
and *BS type 1-H* in table 6.3.2.2-1.

## 9.7 OTA unwanted emissions

### 9.7.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and
spurious emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 \[2\]. In
ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the *BS channel bandwidth* resulting from the
modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding
spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products,
but exclude out of band emissions.

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the *BS type 1-O* and *BS
type 2-O* transmitter is specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel
Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and operating band unwanted emissions (OBUE).
The OTA Operating band unwanted emissions define all unwanted emissions
in each supported downlink *operating band* plus the frequency ranges
Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~ below each band. OTA Unwanted emissions
outside of this frequency range are limited by an OTA spurious emissions
requirement.

The maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from
the *operating band* edge is Δf~OBUE~. The value of Δf~OBUE~ is defined
in table 9.7.1-1 for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* for the NR
*operating bands*.

band*

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The unwanted emission requirements are applied per cell for all the
configurations. Requirements for OTA unwanted emissions are captured
using TRP, *directional requirements* or co-location requirements as
described per requirement.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.

For band n104, the values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 9.7.1-1a.

### 9.7.2 OTA occupied bandwidth

#### 9.7.2.1 General

The OTA occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that,
below the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers
emitted are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[3\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The OTA occupied bandwidth requirement shall apply during the
*transmitter ON period* for a single transmitted carrier. The minimum
requirement below may be applied regionally. There may also be regional
requirements to declare the OTA occupied bandwidth according to the
definition in the present clause.

The OTA occupied bandwidth is defined as a *directional requirement* and
shall be met in the manufacturer\'s declared *OTA coverage range* at the
RIB.

#### 9.7.2.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type* 2-O

The OTA occupied bandwidth for each NR carrier shall be less than the
*BS channel bandwidth*. For intra-band contiguous CA, the OTA occupied
bandwidth shall be less than or equal to the *Aggregated BS Channel
Bandwidth*.

### 9.7.3 OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 9.7.3.1 General

OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The
measured power is TRP.

The requirement shall be applied per RIB during the *transmitter ON
period*.

#### 9.7.3.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

The ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limits* in table 6.6.3.2-2 + X,
6.6.3.2-2a + X (where X = 9 dB) or the ACLR (CACLR) *basic limit* in
table 6.6.3.2-1, 6.6.3.2-2a or 6.6.3.2-3, whichever is less stringent,
shall apply.

For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA, the ACLR
requirements in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply to *BS channel bandwidths* of
the outermost carrier for the frequency ranges defined in table
6.6.3.2-1.For a RIB operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the ACLR
requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the
frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-2a, while the CACLR
requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the
frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-3.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the ACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall
apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in
table 6.6.3.2-2a, while the CACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall
apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in
table 6.6.3.2-3.

#### 9.7.3.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

The OTA ACLR limit is specified in table 9.7.3.3-1.

The OTA ACLR absolute limit is specified in table 9.7.3.3-2.

The OTA ACLR (CACLR) absolute limit in table 9.7.3.3-2 or 9.7.3.3-4a or
the ACLR (CACLR) limit in table 9.7.3.3-1, 9.7.3.3-3 or 9.7.3.3-4,
whichever is less stringent, shall apply.

For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA, the OTA ACLR
requirements in table 9.7.3.3-1 shall apply to *BS channel bandwidths*
of the outermost carrier for the frequency ranges defined in the
table.For a RIB operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the OTA ACLR
requirement in table 9.7.3.3-3 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the
frequency ranges defined in the table, while the OTA CACLR requirement
in table 9.7.3.3-4 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the frequency
ranges defined in the table.

The CACLR in a *sub-block gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *sub-block
gap*, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective *sub-block* edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 9.7.3.3-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined in
table 9.7.3.3-5.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the CACLR for NR carriers
located on either side of the *sub-block gap* shall be higher than the
value specified in table 9.7.3.3-4.

### 9.7.4 OTA operating band unwanted emissions

#### 9.7.4.1 General

The OTA limits for operating band unwanted emissions are specified as
TRP per RIB unless otherwise stated.

#### 9.7.4.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

Out-of-band emissions in FR1 are limited by OTA operating band unwanted
emission limits. Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted
emission limits in FR1 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported downlink *operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~
above the highest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*.
The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 9.7.1-1 for the NR
*operating bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification. For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA,
the requirements apply to *BS channel bandwidths* of the outermost
carrier for the frequency ranges defined in clause 6.6.4.1.

For a *RIB* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the requirements
shall apply inside any *sub-block gap* for the frequency ranges defined
in clause 6.6.4.1.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the requirements shall apply inside any *Inter
RF Bandwidth gap* for the frequency ranges defined in clause 6.6.4.1.

The OTA operating band unwanted emission requirement for *BS type 1-O*
is that for each applicable *basic limit* for *BS type 1-H* in clause
6.6.4.2, the power of any unwanted emission shall not exceed an OTA
limit specified as the *basic limit* + X, where X = 9 dB.

##### 9.7.4.2.1 Additional requirements

###### 9.7.4.2.1.1 Protection of DTT

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For *BS type 1-O* operating in Band n20, the level of emissions in
the band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter bandwidth on centre
frequencies F~filter~ according to table 9.7.4.2.1.1-1, shall not exceed
the maximum emission TRP level shown in the table. This requirement
applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though part of the range
falls in the spurious domain.

###### 9.7.4.2.1.2 Limits in FCC Title 47

The BS may have to comply with the applicable emission limits
established by FCC Title 47 \[8\], when deployed in regions where those
limits are applied, and under the conditions declared by the
manufacturer.

#### 9.7.4.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

##### 9.7.4.3.1 General

The requirements of either clause 9.7.4.3.2 (Category A limits) or
clause 9.7.4.3.3 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for General
OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements (*BS type 2-O*) in
clause 9.7.5.3.2. In addition, the limits in clause 9.7.4.3.4 may also
apply.

Out-of-band emissions in FR2 are limited by OTA operating band unwanted
emission limits. Unless otherwise stated, the OTA operating band
unwanted emission limits in FR2 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band* up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*. The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 9.7.1-1
for the NR *operating bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification. For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA,
the requirements apply to the frequencies (Δf~OBUE~) starting from the
edge of the *contiguous transmission bandwidth.* In addition, for a
*RIB* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the requirements apply
inside any *sub-block gap*.

Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the tables
below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *contiguous transmission bandwidth*
edge frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter
closest to the *contiguous transmission bandwidth* edge.

\- f_offset is the separation between the *contiguous transmission

\- f_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 9.7.1-1.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

In addition, inside any *sub-block gap* for a *RIB* operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the limits specified for the adjacent *sub-blocks* on each side of
the *sub-block gap*. The limit for each *sub-block* is specified in
clauses 9.7.4.3.2 and 9.7.4.3.3 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *sub-block*
edge.

\- f_offset is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f_offset~max~ is equal to the *sub-block gap* bandwidth minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

### 9.7.5 OTA transmitter spurious emissions

#### 9.7.5.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.

The OTA spurious emissions limits are specified as TRP per RIB unless
otherwise stated.

#### 9.7.5.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

##### 9.7.5.2.1 General

The OTA transmitter spurious emission limits for FR1 shall apply from
30 MHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below
the lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 9.7.1-1. For
some FR1 *operating bands*, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in
order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the downlink *operating
band*, as specified in ITU-R recommendation SM.329 \[2\].

For *multi-band RIB* each supported *operating band* and Δf~OBUE~ MHz
around each band are excluded from the OTA transmitter spurious
emissions requirements.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

*BS type 1-O* requirements consists of OTA transmitter spurious emission
requirements based on TRP and co-location requirements not based on TRP.

##### 9.7.5.2.2 General OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

The Tx spurious emissions requirements for *BS type 1-O* are that for
each applicable *basic limit* above 30 MHz in clause 6.6.5.2.1, the TRP
of any spurious emission shall not exceed an OTA limit specified as the
*basic limit* + X, where X = 9 dB, unless stated differently in regional
regulation.

##### 9.7.5.2.3 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS

This requirement shall be applied for NR FDD operation in order to
prevent the receivers of own or a different BS of the same band being
desensitised by emissions from a type 1-O BS.

This requirement is a co-location requirement as defined in clause 4.9,
the power levels are specified at the *co-location reference antenna*
output.

The total power of any spurious emission from both polarizations of the
*co-location reference antenna* connector output shall not exceed the
*basic limits* in clause 6.6.5.2.2 + X dB, where X = -21 dB.

##### 9.7.5.2.4 Additional spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of systems
operating in frequency ranges other than the BS downlink *operating
band*. The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems
that are deployed in the same geographical area as the BS, or they may
be set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an
NR *operating band*. It is in some cases not stated in the present
document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact
circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or
regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the present
document is given in clause 4.5.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.). The Tx additional spurious emissions
requirements for *BS type 1-O* are that for each applicable *basic
limit* in clause 6.6.5.2.3, the TRP of any spurious emission shall not
exceed an OTA limit specified as the *basic limit* + X, where X = 9 dB.

##### 9.7.5.2.5 Co-location with other base stations

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA
TDD, E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.

The requirements assume co-location with base stations of the same
class.

NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on
co-location with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.

This requirement is a co-location requirement as defined in clause 4.9,
the power levels are specified at the *co-location reference antenna*
output(s).

The power sum of any spurious emission is specified over all supported
polarizations at the output(s) of the *co-location reference antenna*
and shall not exceed the *basic limits* in clause 6.6.5.2.4 + X dB,
where X = -21 dB.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the exclusions and conditions in the notes
column of table 6.6.5.2.4-1 apply for each supported *operating band*.

#### 9.7.5.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

##### 9.7.5.3.1 General

In FR2, the OTA transmitter spurious emission limits apply from 30 MHz
to 2^nd^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the downlink *operating
band*, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of the downlink *operating band*, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of the downlink *operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~
is defined in table 9.7.1-1.

##### 9.7.5.3.2 General OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

##### 9.7.5.3.2.1 General {#general-84 .H6}

The requirements of either clause 9.7.5.3.2.2 (Category A limits) or
clause 9.7.5.3.2.3 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for
Operating band unwanted emissions in clause 9.7.4.3.

Table 9.7.5.3.2-1: Void

NOTE: Table 9.7.5.3.2-1 is moved to clause 9.7.5.3.2.2 as Table
9.7.5.3.2.2-1.

##### 9.7.5.3.2.2 OTA transmitter spurious emissions (Category A) {#ota-transmitter-spurious-emissions-category-a .H6}

##### 9.7.5.3.3 Additional OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of systems
operating in frequency ranges other than the BS downlink operating band.
The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are
deployed in the same geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by
local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR
operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the present document
whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances
that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation.
An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in
clause 4.5.

## 9.8 OTA transmitter intermodulation

### 9.8.1 General

The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals
in its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and
antenna array from a co-located base station. The requirement shall
apply during the *transmitter ON period* and the *transmitter transient
period*.

The requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
*operating band*.

The transmitter intermodulation level is the *total radiated power* of
the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into
the *co-location reference antenna*.

The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is not applicable for
*BS type 2-O*.

### 9.8.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

For *BS type 1-O* the transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed
the TRP unwanted emission limits specified for OTA transmitter spurious
emission in clause 9.7.5.2 (except clause 9.7.5.2.3 and clause
9.7.5.2.5), OTA operating band unwanted emissions in clause 9.7.4.2 and
OTA ACLR in clause 9.7.3.2 in the presence of a wanted signal and an
interfering signal, defined in table 9.8.2-1.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the
requirement is also applicable inside a *sub-block gap* for interfering
signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the
*sub-block gap*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *sub-block* edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in multiple *operating bands*, the
requirement shall apply relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth*
*edges* of each *operating band*. In case the *inter RF Bandwidth gap*
is less than 3\*BW~Channel~ (where BW~Channel~ is the minimal *BS
channel bandwidth* of the band), the requirement in the gap shall apply
only for interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls
completely within the *inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

#  10 Radiated receiver characteristics

## 10.1 General

Radiated receiver characteristics are specified at RIB for *BS type
1-H*, *BS type 1-O*, or *BS type 2-O*, with full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating condition.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for the
radiated receiver characteristics requirements in clause 10:

\- Requirements apply during the BS receive period.

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- For FDD operation the requirements shall be met with the transmitter
unit(s) ON.

\- Throughput requirements defined for the radiated receiver
characteristics do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- When BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

\- For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative
offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the lower *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block gap*,
and the positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the
upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a
*sub-block gap*.

\- Each requirement shall be met over the RoAoA specified.

NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the BS in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time.

NOTE 2: In normal operating condition the BS in TDD operation is
configured to TX OFF power during *receive period*.

For FR1 requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*
absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10\*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) dB
for the reference direction

and

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10\*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) dB
for all other directions

For requirements which are to be met over the *minSENS RoAoA* absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)

For FR2 requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*
absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~FR2_REFSENS~ = -3 dB for the reference direction

and

Δ~FR2_REFSENS~ = 0 dB for all other directions

## 10.2 OTA sensitivity

### 10.2.1 *BS type 1-H* and *BS type 1-O*

#### 10.2.1.1 General

The OTA sensitivity requirement is a *directional requirement* based
upon the declaration of one or more *OTA sensitivity direction
declarations* (OSDD), related to a *BS type 1-H* and *BS type 1-O*
receiver.

The *BS type 1-H* and *BS type 1-O* may optionally be capable of
redirecting/changing the *receiver target* by means of adjusting BS
settings resulting in multiple *sensitivity RoAoA*. The *sensitivity
RoAoA* resulting from the current BS settings is the active *sensitivity
RoAoA*.

If the BS is capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related to the
OSDD then the OSDD shall include:

\- *BS channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS level applicable to
any active *sensitivity RoAoA* inside the *receiver target redirection
range* in the OSDD.

\- A declared *receiver target redirection range*, describing all the
angles of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative
settings in the BS.

\- Five declared *sensitivity RoAoA* comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in TS 38.141‑2 \[6\].

\- The *receiver target reference direction*.

NOTE 1: Some of the declared *sensitivity RoAoA* may coincide depending
on the redirection capability.

NOTE 2: In addition to the declared *sensitivity RoAoA*, several
*sensitivity RoAoA* may be implicitly defined by the *receiver target
redirection range* without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.

NOTE 3: (Void)

If the BS is not capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related to
the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:

\- The set(s) of RAT, *BS channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS
level applicable to the *sensitivity RoAoA* in the OSDD.

\- One declared active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

\- The *receiver target reference direction*.

NOTE 4: For BS without target redirection capability, the declared
(fixed) *sensitivity RoAoA* is always the active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match*.

#### 10.2.1.2 Minimum requirement

For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the
active *sensitivity RoAoA* of an OSDD, the error rate criterion as
described in clause 7.2 shall be met when the level of the arriving
signal is equal to the minimum EIS level in the respective declared set
of EIS level and *BS channel bandwidth*.

### 10.2.2 *BS type 2-O*

There is no OTA sensitivity requirement for FR2, the OTA sensitivity is
the same as the OTA reference sensitivity in clause 10.3.

## 10.3 OTA reference sensitivity level

### 10.3.1 General

The OTA REFSENS requirement is a *directional requirement* and is
intended to ensure the minimum OTA reference sensitivity level for a
declared *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*. The OTA reference sensitivity power level
EIS~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean power received at the RIB at which a
reference performance requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel.

The OTA REFSENS requirement shall apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.3.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in the corresponding table and annex
A.1 when the OTA test signal is at the corresponding EIS~REFSENS~ level
and arrives from any direction within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

### 10.3.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in the corresponding table and annex
A.1 when the OTA test signal is at the corresponding EIS~REFSENS~ level
and arrives from any direction within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*.

EIS~REFSENS~ levels are derived from a single declared basis level
EIS~REFSENS_50M,~ which is based on a reference measurement channel with
50 MHz *BS channel bandwidth*. EIS~REFSENS_50M~ itself is not a
requirement and although it is based on a reference measurement channel
with 50 MHz *BS channel bandwidth* it does not imply that BS has to
support 50 MHz *BS channel bandwidth*.

For Wide Area BS, EIS~REFSENS_50M~ is an integer value in the range -96
to -119 dBm. The specific value is declared by the vendor.

For Medium Range BS, EIS~REFSENS_50M~ is an integer value in the range
-91 to -114 dBm. The specific value is declared by the vendor.

For Local Area BS, EIS~REFSENS_50M~ is an integer value in the range -86
to -109 dBm. The specific value is declared by the vendor.

## 10.4 OTA dynamic range

### 10.4.1 General

The OTA dynamic range is a measure of the capability of the receiver
unit to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering signal
inside the received *BS channel bandwidth*.

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.4.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

For NR, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel.

## 10.5 OTA in-band selectivity and blocking

### 10.5.1 OTA adjacent channel selectivity

#### 10.5.1.1 General

OTA Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive an OTA wanted signal at its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of an OTA adjacent channel signal with a
specified centre frequency offset of the interfering signal to the band
edge of a victim system.

#### 10.5.1.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR1 except for band n104 , the OTA wanted and the interfering signal
are specified in table 10.5.1.2-1 and table 10.5.1.2-2 for OTA ACS. For
band n104 , the OTA wanted and the interfering signal are specified in
table 10.5.1.2-1a and table 10.5.1.2-2 for OTA ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is further specified in
annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex D.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The OTA interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *Base station RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio
Bandwidth edges*.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside
any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as
wide as the NR interfering signal in table 10.5.1.2-2. The OTA
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges
inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap* size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in table
10.5.1.2-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth* edges inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

#### 10.5.1.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR2, the OTA wanted and the interfering signal are specified in
table 10.5.1.3-1 and table 10.5.1.3-2 for OTA ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is further specified in
annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex D.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth*. The OTA interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
Base station *RF Bandwidth edges*.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside
any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as
wide as the NR interfering signal in table 10.5.1.3-2. The OTA
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges
inside the *sub-block gap*.

### 10.5.2 OTA in-band blocking

#### 10.5.2.1 General

The OTA in-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive a OTA wanted signal at its assigned channel in the
presence of an unwanted OTA interferer, which is an NR signal for
general blocking or an NR signal with one RB for narrowband blocking.

#### 10.5.2.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and:

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with OTA wanted and OTA interfering signal
specified in tables 10.5.2.2-1, table 10.5.2.2-2 and table 10.5.2.2-3
for general OTA and narrowband OTA blocking requirements. Narrowband
blocking requirements are not applied for band n104. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is identified in clause
10.3.2 and are further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex D.

The OTA in-band blocking requirements apply outside the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio
Bandwidth* edges.

For *BS type 1-O* the OTA in-band blocking requirement shall apply in
the in-band blocking frequency range, which is from F~UL,low~ - Δf~OOB~
to F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~, excluding the downlink frequency range of the
FDD *operating band.* The Δf~OOB~ for *BS type 1-O* is defined in table
10.5.2.2-0 except for band n104 and 10.5.2.2-0a for band n104.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  BS type        *Operating band* characteristics          Δf~OOB~ (MHz)
  -------------- ----------------------------------------- --------------
  *BS type 1-O*  F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ \< 100 MHz        20

                 100 MHz ≤ F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 900   60
                 MHz                                       
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

For band n104, Δf~OOB~ for *BS type 1-O* is defined in table
10.5.2.2-0a.

  *BS type 1-O*         n104                        100

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA in-band blocking requirements apply in
addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is
at least as wide as twice the interfering signal minimum offset in table
10.5.2.2-1. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA in-band blocking requirements apply in
the in-band blocking frequency ranges for each supported *operating
band*. The requirement shall apply in addition inside any *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least as
wide as twice the interfering signal minimum offset in tables 10.5.2.2-1
and 10.5.2.2-3.

For a RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA narrowband blocking requirements apply in
addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is
at least as wide as the interfering signal minimum offset in table
10.5.2.2-3. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA narrowband blocking requirements apply
in the narrowband blocking frequency ranges for each supported
*operating band*. The requirement shall apply in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is
at least as wide as the interfering signal minimum offset in table
10.5.2.2-3.

#### 10.5.2.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For *BS type 2-O*, the OTA wanted and OTA interfering signals are
provided at RIB using the parameters in table 10.5.2.3-1 for general OTA
blocking requirements. The reference measurement channel for the wanted
signal is further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of the
interfering signal is further specified in annex D.

The OTA blocking requirements are applicable outside the *Base Station
RF Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth* edges.

For *BS type 2-O* the OTA in-band blocking requirement shall apply from
F~UL_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to F~UL_high~ + Δf~OOB~*.* The Δf~OOB~ for *BS type
2-O* is defined in table 10.5.2.3-0.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA blocking requirements apply in addition inside
any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as
wide as twice the interfering signal minimum offset in table 10.5.2.3-1.
The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *sub-block*
edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

## 10.6 OTA out-of-band blocking

### 10.6.1 General

The OTA out-of-band blocking characteristics are a measure of the
receiver unit ability to receive a wanted signal at the *RIB* at its
assigned channel in the presence of an unwanted interferer.

### 10.6.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

#### 10.6.2.1 General minimum requirement

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted signal applies to each supported polarization, under the
assumption of *polarization match.* The interferer shall be
*polarization matched* in-band and the polarization maintained for
out-of-band frequencies.

For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signals provided at the RIB using the
parameters in table 10.6.2.1-1, the following requirements shall be met:

\- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the
OTA wanted signal is identified in clause 10.3.2 for each *BS channel
bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the OTA out-of-band requirement shall apply for
each supported *operating band*, with the exception that the in-band
blocking frequency ranges of all supported *operating bands* according
to clause 7.4.2.2 shall be excluded from the OTA out‑of‑band blocking
requirement.

For *BS type 1-O* the OTA out-of-band blocking requirement apply from 30
MHz to F~UL,low~ - Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750
MHz, including the downlink frequency range of the FDD *operating band*
for BS supporting FDD. The Δf~OOB~ for *BS type 1-O* is defined in table
10.5.2.2-0.

#### 10.6.2.2 Co-location minimum requirement

This additional OTA out-of-band blocking requirement may be applied for
the protection of BS receivers when NR, E‑UTRA BS, UTRA BS, CDMA BS or
GSM/EDGE BS operating in a different frequency band are co-located with
a BS.

The requirement is a co-location requirement. The interferer power
levels are specified at the *co-location reference antenna* conducted
input. The interfering signal power is specified per supported
polarization.

The requirement is valid over the *minSENS RoAoA*.

For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signal provided at the RIB using the
parameters in table 10.6.2.1-1, the following requirements shall be met:

\- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the
OTA wanted signal is identified in clause 10.3.2 for each *BS channel
bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1.

For *BS type 1-O* the OTA blocking requirement for co-location with BS
in other frequency bands is applied for all *operating bands* for which
co-location protection is provided.

## 10.7 OTA receiver spurious emissions

### 10.7.1 General

The OTA RX spurious emission is the power of the emissions radiated from
the antenna array from a receiver unit.

The metric used to capture OTA receiver spurious emissions for *BS type
1-O* and *BS type 2-O* is *total radiated power* (TRP), with the
requirement defined at the RIB.

### 10.7.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

For a BS operating in FDD, OTA RX spurious emissions requirement do not
apply as they are superseded by the OTA TX spurious emissions
requirement. This is due to the fact that TX and RX spurious emissions
cannot be distinguished in OTA domain.

For a BS operating in TDD, the OTA RX spurious emissions requirement
shall apply during the *transmitter OFF period* only.

For RX only *multi-band RIB*, the OTA RX spurious emissions requirements
are subject to exclusion zones in each supported *operating band*.

The OTA RX spurious emissions requirement for *BS type 1-O* is that for
each *basic limit* specified in table 10.7.2‑1*,* the power sum of
emissions at the RIB shall not exceed limits specified as the *basic
limit* + X, where X = 9 dB, unless stated differently in regional
regulation.

In addition to the requirements in Table 10.7.3-1, the requirement for
protection of EESS for BS operating in frequency range 24.25 - 27.5 GHz
in clause 9.7.5.3.3 may be applied.

## 10.8 OTA receiver intermodulation

### 10.8.1 General

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver unit to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of two interfering signals which have a
specific frequency relationship to the wanted signal. The requirement is
defined as a *directional requirement* at the *RIB*.

### 10.8.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and:

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two interfering signals at the RIB with the conditions
specified in tables 10.8.2-1 and 10.8.2-2 for intermodulation
performance and in tables 10.8.2-3 and 10.8.2-4 for narrowband
intermodulation performance. Narrowband intermodulation requirements are
not applied for band n104.

The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
table 10.3.2-1, table 10.3.2-2 and table 10.3.2-3 for each *BS channel
bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex D.

The subcarrier spacing for the modulated interfering signal shall be the
same as the subcarrier spacing for the wanted signal, except for the
case of wanted signal subcarrier spacing 60kHz and *BS channel
bandwidth* \<=20MHz, for which the subcarrier spacing of the interfering
signal shall be 30kHz.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth edges*. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* or
*Radio Bandwidth edges*.

For a RIBs supporting operation in non-contiguous spectrum within any
*operating band*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement shall apply
in addition inside any *sub-block gap* in case the *sub-block gap* is at
least as wide as the *BS channel bandwidth* of the NR interfering signal
in tables 10.8.2-2 and 10.8.2-4. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the intermodulation requirement shall apply in
addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the gap size is at
least twice as wide as the NR interfering signal centre frequency offset
from the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement shall
apply in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* in case the gap
size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in tables 10.8.2-2
and 10.8.2-4. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

### 10.8.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals applies to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match.*

Throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with OTA wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two OTA interfering signals provided at the RIB using the
parameters in tables 10.8.3-1 and 10.8.3-2. All of the OTA test signals
arrive from the same direction, and the requirement is valid if the
signals arrive from any direction within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*. The
reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
table 10.3.3-1 for each *BS channel bandwidth* and further specified in
annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex D.

The subcarrier spacing for the modulated interfering signal shall be the
same as the subcarrier spacing for the wanted signal except for FR2-2
with 400MHz, 800MHz, 1600MHz and 2000MHz case.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*.

## 10.9 OTA in-channel selectivity

### 10.9.1 General

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations in the
presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power spectral
density. In this condition a throughput requirement shall be met for a
specified reference measurement channel. The interfering signal shall be
an NR signal as specified in annex A.1 and shall be time aligned with
the wanted signal.

### 10.9.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are the same direction
and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*

The wanted and interfering signals applies to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match.*

For *BS type 1-O*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in annex
A.1 with parameters specified:

\- In table 10.9.2-1 for Wide Area BS, in table 10.9.2-2 for Medium
Range BS and in table 10.9.2-3 for Local Area BS except in operating
band n104.

\- In table 10.9.2-1a for Wide Area BS, in table 10.9.2-2a for Medium
Range BS and in table 10.9.2-3a for Local Area BS in operating band
n104.

The characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in
annex D.

### 10.9.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals applies to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match.*

For *BS type 2-O*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in annex
A.1 with parameters specified in table 10.9.3-1. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex D.

#  11 Radiated performance requirements

## 11.1 General

### 11.1.1 Scope and definitions

Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the *BS type
1-O* or *BS type 2-O* to correctly demodulate radiated signals in
various conditions and configurations. Radiated performance requirements
are specified at the RIB.

Radiated performance requirements for the BS are specified for the fixed
reference channels defined in annex A and the propagation conditions in
annex G. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that are supported by
the BS.

The radiated performance requirements for *BS type 1-O* and for the *BS
type 2-O* are limited to two OTA *demodulation branches* as described in
clause 11.1.2. Conformance requirements can only be tested for 1 or 2
*demodulation branches* depending on the number of polarizations
supported by the BS, with the required SNR applied separately per
polarization.

NOTE 1: The BS can support more than 2 *demodulation branches*, however
OTA conformance testing can only be performed for 1 or 2 *demodulation
branches*.

Unless stated otherwise, radiated performance requirements apply for a
single carrier only. Radiated performance requirements for a BS
supporting CA are defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

For *BS type 1-O* in FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall be
met with the transmitter units associated with the RIB in the
*operating* *band* turned ON.

NOTE 2: *BS type 1-O* in normal operating conditions in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The transmitter
unit(s) associated with the RIB may be OFF for some of the tests.

In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may
be provided from the BS to the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.

Whenever the \"RX antennas\" term is used for the radiated performance
requirements description, it shall refer to the *demodulation branches*
(i.e. not physical antennas of the antenna array).

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in a slot on a RIB.

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the *transmission
bandwidth* over the duration where signal energy exists on a RIB.

### 11.1.2 OTA demodulation branches

Radiated performance requirements are only specified for up to 2
*demodulation branches*.

If the *BS type 1-O*, or the *BS type 2-O* uses polarization diversity
and has the ability to maintain isolation between the signals for each
of the *demodulation branches*, then radiated performance requirements
can be tested for up to two *demodulation branches* (i.e. 1RX or 2RX
test setups). When tested for two *demodulation branches*, each
demodulation branch maps to one polarization.

If the *BS type 1-O*, or the *BS type 2-O* does not use polarization
diversity then radiated performance requirements can only be tested for
a single *demodulation branch* (i.e. 1RX test setup).

### 11.2.2 Requirements for *BS type 2-O*

#### 11.2.2.1 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

##### 11.2.2.1.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

#### 11.2.2.2 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

##### 11.2.2.2.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in Annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

#### 11.2.2.3 Requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH

##### 11.2.2.3.1 General

In the tests for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH, the UCI information only
contains CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information, and there is no HACK/ACK
information transmitted.

The CSI part 1 block error probability (BLER) is defined as the
probability of incorrectly decoding the CSI part 1 information when the
CSI part 1 information is sent as follow:

${BLER}_{CSI\ part\ 1} = \ \frac{\#(false\ CSI\ part\ 1)}{\#(CSI\ part\ 1)}$

where:

\- #(false CSI part 1) denotes the number of incorrectly decoded CSI
part 1 information transmitted occasions

\- #(CSI part 1) denotes the number of CSI part 1information transmitted
occasions.

The CSI part 2 block error probability is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the CSI part 2 information when the CSI part 2
information is sent as follows:

${BLER}_{CSI\ part\ 2} = \ \frac{\#(false\ CSI\ part\ 2)}{\#(CSI\ part\ 2)}$

where:

\- #(false CSI part 2) denotes the number of incorrectly decoded CSI
part 2 information transmitted occasions

\- #(CSI part 2) denotes the number of CSI part 2 information
transmitted occasions.

The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined for two
cases as follows:

\- 5 bits in CSI part 1, 2 bits in CSI part 2

\- 20 bits in CSI part 1, 20 bits in CSI part 2

The 7bits UCI case is further defined with the bitmap \[c0 c1 c2 c3 c4\]
= \[0 1 0 1 0\] for CSI part 1 information, where c0 is mapping to the
RI information, and with the bitmap \[c0 c1\] = \[1 0\] for CSI part2
information.

The 40bits UCI information case is assumed random information bits
selection.

In both tests, PUSCH data, CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information are
transmitted simultaneously.

#### 11.2.2.4 Requirements for PUSCH for 2-step RA type

##### 11.2.2.4.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH for 2-step RA type is determined by
a minimum required block error rate of MsgA for a given SNR for the FRCs
listed in annex A. The performance requirements assume that the
precedent preamble of MsgA is correctly detected in a 2-step RA type
procedure and no HARQ retransmissions.

The performance requirements are applicable for wide area and medium
range BS that support 2-step RA type. The performance requirements are
not applied for a local area BS that supports 2-step RA type.

#### 11.2.2.5 Requirements for PUSCH repetition Type A

##### 11.2.2.5.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a maximum block
error rate (BLER) for a given SNR. The BLER is defined as the
probability of incorrectly decoding the PUSCH information when the PUSCH
information is sent. The performance requirements assume HARQ
retransmissions.

#### 11.2.2.6 Requirements for PUSCH mapping Type B with non-slot transmission

##### 11.2.2.6.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughtput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

#### 11.2.2.7 Requirements for PUSCH for high speed train

##### 11.2.2.7.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions. The performance
requirements for high speed train are optional and only applicable for
FR2-1 below 30GHz.

The performance requirements for PUSCH high speed train apply to Wide
Area Base Stations and Medium Range Base Stations (subject to
declaration).

#### 11.2.2.8 Requirements for UL timing adjustment

##### 11.2.2.8.1 General

The performance requirement of UL timing adjustment is determined by a
minimum required throughput for the moving UE at given SNR. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions. The performance
requirements for UL timing adjustment scenario Y defined in Annex G.4
are optional and only applicable for FR2-1 below 30GHz.

In the tests for UL timing adjustment, two signals are configured, one
being transmitted by a moving UE and the other being transmitted by a
stationary UE. The transmission of SRS from UE is optional. FRC
parameters in Tables A.10-4, A.10-5, and A.10-6 are applied for both
UEs. The received power for both UEs is the same. The resource blocks
allocated for both UEs are consecutive. In scenario Y, Doppler shift is
not taken into account.

#### 11.2.2.10 Requirements for PUSCH with DM-RS bundling

##### 11.2.2.10.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

##### 11.3.2.3.1 NACK to ACK requirements

###### 11.3.2.3.1.1 General

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability that an ACK bit
is falsely detected when an NACK bit was sent on the particular bit
position, where the NACK to ACK detection probability is defined as
follows:

![](./38104/media/image27.wmf){width="4.201388888888889in"
height="0.4027777777777778in"}

where:

\- ![](./38104/media/image28.wmf){width="1.2013888888888888in"
height="0.2013888888888889in"} denotes the total number of NACK bits
transmitted

\- ![](./38104/media/image29.wmf){width="2.0in"
height="0.2013888888888889in"} denotes the number of NACK bits decoded
as ACK bits at the receiver, i.e. the number of received ACK bits

\- NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are
mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be
considered.

Random codeword selection is assumed.

#### 11.3.2.6 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 4

##### 11.3.2.6.1 General

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-2 \[18\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC centre, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

#### 11.3.2.7 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1 with DMRS bundling

##### 11.3.2.7.1 NACK to ACK requirements

###### 11.3.2.7.1.1 General

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability that an ACK bit
is falsely detected when an NACK bit was sent on the particular bit
position, where the NACK to ACK detection probability is defined as
follows:

![](./38104/media/image27.wmf){width="4.173611111111111in"
height="0.3909722222222222in"},

where:

\- ![](./38104/media/image28.wmf){width="1.1784722222222221in"
height="0.2076388888888889in"}denotes the total number of NACK bits
transmitted

\- ![](./38104/media/image29.wmf){width="2.0493055555555557in"
height="0.2076388888888889in"}denotes the number of NACK bits decoded as
ACK bits at the receiver, i.e. the number of received ACK bits

\- NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are
mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be
considered.

The NACK to ACK detection probability performance requirement only apply
to PUCCH format 1 with 2 UCI bits. The UCI information only contain
ACK/NACK information.

The 2bits UCI information is further defined with bitmap as \[0 1\].

## 11.4 Performance requirements for PRACH

### 11.4.1 Requirements for *BS type 1-O*

#### 11.4.1.1 PRACH False alarm probability

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.4.1 for 2Rx.

#### 11.4.1.2 PRACH detection requirements

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.4.2 for 2Rx.

### 11.4.2 Requirements for *BS type 2-O*

#### 11.4.2.1 PRACH False alarm probability

##### 11.4.2.1.1 General

The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas,
for any channel bandwidth.

The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of
erroneous detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any
detector) when input is only noise.

##### 11.4.2.1.2 Minimum requirement

The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.

#### 11.4.2.2 PRACH detection requirements

##### 11.4.2.2.1 General

The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several
error cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent,
not detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with
the wrong timing estimation. For AWGN and TDLA30-300, a timing
estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the
strongest path is larger than the time error tolerance given in Table
11.4.2.2-1.

The performance requirements for high speed train (table 11.4.2.2.3-1)
are optional and only applicable for FR2-1 below 30GHz.

########  Annex B (normative): Error Vector Magnitude (FR1)

# B.1 Reference point for measurement

The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a zero-forcing
(ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted in figure B.1-1 below.

![](./38104/media/image35.emf)

Figure B.1-1: Reference point for EVM measurement

# B.2 Basic unit of measurement

The basic unit of EVM measurement is defined over one slot in the time
domain and ![](./38104/media/image36.wmf) subcarriers in the frequency
domain:

![](./38104/media/image37.wmf)

where

*T* is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
active within the slot,

![](./38104/media/image38.wmf)is the set of subcarriers within the
![](./38104/media/image39.wmf) subcarriers with the considered
modulation scheme being active in symbol *t*,

![](./38104/media/image40.wmf) is the ideal signal reconstructed by the
measurement equipment in accordance with relevant Tx models,

![](./38104/media/image41.wmf) is the modified signal under test defined
in annex B.3.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the impact of
noise in the reference signals. The boundaries of the 10 ms measurement
intervals need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

# B.3 Modified signal under test

Implicit in the definition of EVM is an assumption that the receiver is
able to compensate a number of transmitter impairments. The signal under
test is equalized and decoded according to:

![](./38104/media/image42.wmf)

where

![](./38104/media/image43.wmf) is the time domain samples of the signal
under test.

![](./38104/media/image44.wmf) is the sample timing difference between
the FFT processing window in relation to nominal timing of the ideal
signal. Note that two timing offsets are determined, the corresponding
EVM is measured and the maximum used as described in annex B.7.

![](./38104/media/image45.wmf) is the RF frequency offset.

![](./38104/media/image46.wmf) is the phase response of the TX chain.

![](./38104/media/image47.wmf) is the amplitude response of the TX
chain.

# B.4 Estimation of frequency offset

The observation period for determining the frequency offset
![](./38104/media/image45.wmf) shall be 1 slot.

# B.5 Estimation of time offset

## B.5.1 General

The observation period for determining the sample timing difference
![](./38104/media/image44.wmf)shall be 1 slot.

In the following ![](./38104/media/image48.wmf) represents the middle
sample of the EVM window of length *W* (defined in annex B.5.2) or the
last sample of the first window half if *W* is even.

![](./38104/media/image48.wmf)is estimated so that the EVM window of
length *W* is centred on the measured cyclic prefix of the considered
OFDM symbol. To minimize the estimation error the timing shall be based
on demodulation reference signals. To limit time distortion of any
transmit filter the reference signals in the 1 outer RBs are not taken
into account in the timing estimation

Two values for ![](./38104/media/image49.wmf) are determined:

![](./38104/media/image50.wmf) and

![](./38104/media/image51.wmf) where ![](./38104/media/image52.wmf) if
*W* is odd and ![](./38104/media/image53.wmf) if *W* is even.

When the cyclic prefix length varies from symbol to symbol then *T*
shall be further restricted to the subset of symbols with the considered
modulation scheme being active and with the considered cyclic prefix
length type.

## B.5.2 Window length

Table B.5.2-1, B.5.2-2, B.5.2-3 specify the EVM window length (*W*) for
normal CP.

height="0.2152777777777778in"} are determined as follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal
![](./38104/media/image56.wmf){width="0.5555555555555556in"
height="0.2152777777777778in"} and the post-FFT ideal signal
![](./38104/media/image57.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"}, for each reference signal, over 10ms
measurement interval. This process creates a set of complex ratios:

![](./38104/media/image58.wmf){width="1.7708333333333333in"
height="0.4583333333333333in"}

Where the post-FFT ideal signal
![](./38104/media/image57.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"} is constructed by the measuring
equipment according to the relevant TX specifications, using the
following parameters: i.e. nominal demodulation reference signals, (all
other modulation symbols are set to 0 V), nominal carrier frequency,
nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier, nominal
timing.

2\. Perform time averaging at each reference signal subcarrier of the
complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10ms measurement interval.
Prior to the averaging of the phases
![](./38104/media/image59.wmf){width="0.5347222222222222in"

angles of ![](./38104/media/image60.wmf){width="0.5347222222222222in"
height="0.25in"} by adding multiples of 2\*PI when absolute phase jumps
between consecutive time instances t~i~ are greater than or equal to the
jump tolerance of PI radians. This process creates an average amplitude
and phase for each reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every second
subcarrier).

obtained by computing the moving average in the frequency domain of the
time-averaged reference signal subcarriers, i.e. every second
subcarrier. The moving average window size is 19 and averaging is over
the DM-RS subcarriers in the allocated RBs. For DM-RS subcarriers at or
near the edge of the channel , or when the number of available DM-RS
subcarriers within a set of contiguously allocated RBs is smaller than
the moving average window size, the window size is reduced accordingly

# B.7 Averaged EVM

EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
$N_{dl}$ slots where $N_{dl}$ is the number of slots in a 10 ms
measurement interval.

For FDD the averaging in the time domain equals the $N_{dl}$ slot
duration of the 10 ms measurement interval from the equalizer estimation
step.

![](./38104/media/image69.wmf){width="2.2847222222222223in"
height="0.7777777777777778in"}

\- Where *Ni* is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

\- The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS
average at the window *W* extremities of the EVM measurements:

\- Thus ![](./38104/media/image70.wmf){width="0.7152777777777778in"
height="0.25in"} is calculated using
![](./38104/media/image71.wmf){width="0.625in" height="0.25in"}in the
expressions above and
![](./38104/media/image72.wmf){width="0.7569444444444444in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} is calculated using
![](./38104/media/image73.wmf){width="0.625in" height="0.25in"} in the
![](./38104/media/image74.wmf){width="0.6805555555555556in"
height="0.2916666666666667in"} calculation.

\- Thus we get:

$$\overline{EVM} = \max\left( {\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$$

For TDD, let $N_{dl}^{TDD}$ be the number of slots with downlink symbols
within a 10 ms measurement interval, the averaging in the time domain
can be calculated from $\ N_{dl}^{TDD}$ slots of different 10 ms
measurement intervals and should have a minimum of $N_{dl}$ slots
averaging length where $N_{dl}$ is the number of slots in a 10 ms
measurement interval.

\- ${\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame}}$ is derived by: Square the EVM
results in each 10 ms measurement interval. Sum the squares, divide the
sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the quotient
(RMS).

$${\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{dl}^{TDD}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{dl}^{TDD}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$$

\- Where $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

\- The ${EVM}_{\text{frame}}$ is calculated, using the maximum of
${\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame}}$ at the window *W* extremities. Thus
${\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ and
${\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ (*l* and *h*, low
and high; where low is the timing $(\mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2)$ and and
high is the timing $(\mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2)$).

$${EVM}_{\text{frame}} = \max\left( {\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$$

\- In order to unite at least $N_{dl}$ slots, consider the minimum
integer number of 10 ms measurement intervals, where $N_{frame}$ is
determined by.

$$N_{frame} = \left\lceil \frac{10 \times N_{slot}}{N_{dl}^{TDD}} \right\rceil$$

and $N_{slot} = 1$ for 15 kHz SCS, $N_{slot} = 2$ for 30 kHz SCS and
$N_{slot} = 4$ for 60 kHz SCS normal CP.

\- Unite by RMS.

$$\overline{EVM} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{frame}}\sum_{k = 1}^{N_{frame}}{EVM}_{frame,k}^{2}}$$

# C.1 Reference point for measurement

The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a zero-forcing
(ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted in figure C.1-1 below.

![](./38104/media/image75.emf)

Figure C.1-1: Reference point for EVM measurement

# C.2 Basic unit of measurement

The basic unit of EVM measurement is defined over one slot in the time
domain and ![](./38104/media/image36.wmf) subcarriers in the frequency
domain:

![](./38104/media/image37.wmf)

where

![](./38104/media/image76.wmf) is the set of symbols with the considered
modulation scheme being active within the slot,

![](./38104/media/image38.wmf)is the set of subcarriers within the
![](./38104/media/image39.wmf) subcarriers with the considered
modulation scheme being active in symbol *t*,

![](./38104/media/image40.wmf) is the ideal signal reconstructed by the
measurement equipment in accordance with relevant Tx models,

![](./38104/media/image41.wmf) is the modified signal under test defined
in C.3.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over 10 ms measurement intervals to reduce the impact of
noise in the reference signals. The boundaries of the 10 ms measurement
intervals need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

# C.3 Modified signal under test

Implicit in the definition of EVM is an assumption that the receiver is
able to compensate a number of transmitter impairments. The signal under
test is equalized and decoded according to:

![](./38104/media/image42.wmf)

where

![](./38104/media/image43.wmf) is the time domain samples of the signal
under test.

![](./38104/media/image44.wmf) is the sample timing difference between
the FFT processing window in relation to nominal timing of the ideal
signal. Note that two timing offsets are determined, the corresponding
EVM is measured and the maximum used as described in C.7.

![](./38104/media/image45.wmf) is the RF frequency offset.

![](./38104/media/image46.wmf) is the phase response of the TX chain.

![](./38104/media/image47.wmf) is the amplitude response of the TX
chain.

# C.4 Estimation of frequency offset

The observation period for determining the frequency offset
![](./38104/media/image45.wmf) shall be 1 slot.

# C.5 Estimation of time offset

## C.5.1 General

The observation period for determining the sample timing difference
![](./38104/media/image44.wmf)shall be 1 slot.

In the following ![](./38104/media/image48.wmf) represents the middle
sample of the EVM window of length ![](./38104/media/image77.wmf)
(defined in C.5.2) or the last sample of the first window half if
![](./38104/media/image77.wmf)is even.

![](./38104/media/image48.wmf)is estimated so that the EVM window of
length ![](./38104/media/image77.wmf) is centred on the measured cyclic
prefix of the considered OFDM symbol. To minimize the estimation error
the timing shall be based on the reference signals. To limit time
distortion of any transmit filter the reference signals in the 1 outer
RBs are not taken into account in the timing estimation

Two values for ![](./38104/media/image49.wmf) are determined:

![](./38104/media/image50.wmf) and

![](./38104/media/image51.wmf) where ![](./38104/media/image52.wmf) if
![](./38104/media/image78.wmf) is odd and ![](./38104/media/image53.wmf)
if ![](./38104/media/image79.wmf)is even.

When the cyclic prefix length varies from symbol to symbol then
![](./38104/media/image80.wmf)shall be further restricted to the subset
of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being active and with
the considered cyclic prefix length type.

# C.6 Estimation of TX chain amplitude and frequency response parameters

The equalizer coefficients
![](./38104/media/image54.wmf){width="0.3819444444444444in"
height="0.2152777777777778in"}and
![](./38104/media/image55.wmf){width="0.4097222222222222in"
height="0.2152777777777778in"} are determined as follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal
![](./38104/media/image56.wmf){width="0.5555555555555556in"
height="0.2152777777777778in"} and the post-FFT ideal signal
![](./38104/media/image57.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"}, for each reference signal, over 10ms
measurement intervals. This process creates a set of complex ratios:

![](./38104/media/image58.wmf){width="1.7708333333333333in"
height="0.4583333333333333in"}

Where the post-FFT ideal signal
![](./38104/media/image57.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"} is constructed by the measuring
equipment according to the relevant TX specifications, using the
following parameters:

\- nominal demodulation reference signals and nominal PT-RS if present
(all other modulation symbols are set to 0 V),

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,

\- nominal timing.

2\. Perform time averaging at each reference signal subcarrier of the
complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10ms measurement interval.
Prior to the averaging of the phases
![](./38104/media/image59.wmf){width="0.5347222222222222in"
height="0.25in"} an unwrap operation must be performed according to the
following definition: The unwrap operation corrects the radian phase
angles of ![](./38104/media/image60.wmf){width="0.5347222222222222in"
height="0.25in"} by adding multiples of 2\*PI when absolute phase jumps
between consecutive time instances t~i~ are greater than or equal to the
jump tolerance of PI radians. This process creates an average amplitude
and phase for each reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every second
subcarrier).

$${a(f) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{a\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}
}{\varphi(f) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{\varphi\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}}$$

Where *N* is the number of reference signal time-domain locations *t~i~*
from $Z'(t,f)$ for each reference signal subcarrier
![](./38104/media/image63.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.2152777777777778in"}.

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase
![](./38104/media/image64.wmf){width="0.375in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"} and
![](./38104/media/image65.wmf){width="0.3819444444444444in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"} at the reference signal subcarriers are
obtained by computing the moving average in the frequency domain of the
time-averaged reference signal subcarriers, i.e. every second
subcarrier. The moving average window size is 19 and averaging is over
the DM-RS subcarriers in allocated RBs. For DM-RS subcarriers at or near
the edge of the channel, or when the number of available DM-RS
subcarriers within a set of contiguously allocated RBs is smaller than
the moving average window size, the window size is reduced accordingly
as per figure C.6-1.

4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients
![](./38104/media/image64.wmf){width="0.375in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"} and
![](./38104/media/image65.wmf){width="0.3819444444444444in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"} to compute coefficients
![](./38104/media/image66.wmf){width="0.3819444444444444in"
height="0.2152777777777778in"},
![](./38104/media/image67.wmf){width="0.4097222222222222in"
height="0.2152777777777778in"} for each subcarrier. To account for the
common phase error (CPE) experienced in millimetre wave frequencies,
$\overline{\varphi}(f)$, in the estimated coefficients contain phase
rotation due to the CPE, $\theta$, in addition to the phase of the
equalizer coefficient $\widetilde{\varphi}(f)$, that is

$$\overline{\varphi}(f) = \widetilde{\varphi}(f) + \theta(t)$$

For OFDM symbols where PT-RS does not exist, $\theta(t)$ can be
estimated by performing linear interpolation from neighboring symbols
where PT-RS is present.

In order to separate component of the CPE,$\ \theta$, contained in,
$\overline{\varphi}(f)$, estimation and compensation of the CPE needs to
follow.$\ \theta(t)$ is the common phase error (CPE), that rotates all
the subcarriers of the OFDM symbol at time $t$.

Estimate of the CPE, $\theta(t)$, at OFDM symbol time, $t$, can then be
obtained from using the PT-RS employing the expression

$$\widetilde{\theta}(t) = \arg\left\{ \sum_{{f \in f}^{ptrs}}^{}\left( \frac{Z^{'}(t,f)}{I_{ptrs}(t,f)} \right)\ \left( \widetilde{a}(f)e^{- j\overline{\varphi}(f)} \right) \right\}$$

In the above equation, $f^{ptrs}$ is the set of subcarriers where PT-RS
are mapped, ${t \in t}^{ptrs}$ where $t^{ptrs}$ is the set of OFDM
symbols where PT-RS are mapped while $Z^{'}(t,f)$ and $I_{ptrs}(t,f)$
are is the post-FFT acquired signal and the ideal PT-RS signal
respectively. That is, estimate of the CPE at a given OFDM symbol is
obtained from frequency correlation of the complex ratios at the PT-RS
positions with the conjugate of the estimated equalizer complex
coefficients. The estimated CPE can be subtracted from
$\overline{\varphi}(f)$ to remove influence of the CPE, and obtain
estimate of the complex coefficient\'s phase

$\widetilde{\varphi}(f) = \overline{\varphi}(f) - \widetilde{\theta}$(t)

# C.7 Averaged EVM

EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
$\ N_{dl}$ slots where $N_{dl}$ is the number of slots in a 10 ms
measurement interval.

For TDD, let $N_{dl}^{TDD}$ be the number of slots with downlink symbols
within a 10 ms measurement interval, the averaging in the time domain
can be calculated from $N_{dl}^{TDD}$ slots of different 10 ms
measurement intervals and should have a minimum of $N_{dl}$ slots
averaging length where $N_{dl}$ is the number of slots in a 10 ms
measurement interval.

\- ${\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame}}$ is derived by: Square the EVM
results in each 10 ms measurement intervals. Sum the squares, divide the
sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the quotient
(RMS).

$${\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{dl}^{TDD}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{dl}^{TDD}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$$

\- Where $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

\- The ${EVM}_{\text{frame}}$ is calculated, using the maximum of
${\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame}}$ at the window *W* extremities. Thus
${\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ and
${\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ (*l* and *h*, low
and high; where low is the timing $(\mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2)$ and and
high is the timing $(\mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2)$).

$${EVM}_{\text{frame}} = \max\left( {\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{EVM}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$$

\- In order to unite at least $N_{dl}$ slots, consider the minimum
integer number of 10 ms measurement intervals, where $N_{frame}$ is
determined by.

$$N_{frame} = \left\lceil \frac{10 \times N_{slot}}{N_{dl}^{TDD}} \right\rceil$$

and $N_{slot} = 4$ for 60 kHz SCS and $N_{slot} = 8$ for 120 kHz SCS.

\- Unite by RMS.

$$\overline{EVM} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{frame}}\sum_{k = 1}^{N_{frame}}{EVM}_{frame,k}^{2}}$$

######## Annex F (normative): Relationship between EIRP based regulatory requirements and 3GPP requirements

# F.1 General

This annex applies to FR1 *BS type 1-C*, *BS type 1-H* and *BS type
1-O*.

Some regional requirements are defined per effective isotropic radiated
power (EIRP), which is a combination of the transmitted power (or in
some cases spectral density) and the effective antenna gain which is a
site-specific condition. Such requirements may be applied per antenna,
per cell, or per base station. It shall be noted that the definition of
BS or cell may differ between regulations.

The regulations are based on the assumption on *BS type 1-C* conducted
requirements and a passive antenna and must be interpreted for active
antenna systems that have active beamforming. This annex describes how
the power per connector and sum power over *TAB connectors* can be
related to such requirements.

Where the regulator prescribes a method for EIRP calculation, that
method supersedes the proposed assessment in this annex.

# F.2 Relationship between EIRP based regulatory requirements and conducted requirements

When 3GPP specifications mandate manufacturer declarations of the
(conducted) output power or power spectral density per connector for the
base station under the reference conditions stated as a way to
accommodate the referred regional requirements without putting
requirements on the local site conditions.

For the case when the base station manufacturer maximum output power or
unwanted emission declarations apply per connector, the maximum EIRP can
be estimated using the following formulas:

EIRP per antenna (applicable for *BS type 1-C*): P~EIRP~ = P~Tx~ +
G~Ant~

EIRP per cell or per BS (applicable for *BS type 1-H*): P~EIRPcell~ =10
\* log (∑10^PEIRPn/10^)

In case the EIRP requirement is set per polarization, the summation
shall be made per polarization.

\- \"P~EIRP~\" is the resulting effective isotropic radiated power (or
radiated power spectral density) resulting from the power (or power
spectral density) declared by the manufacturer in dBm (or
dBm/measurement BW).

\- \"P~Tx~\" is the conducted power or power spectral density declared
by the manufacturer in dBm (or dBm/measurement BW).

\- \"G~Ant~\" is the effective antenna gain, calculated as the antenna
gain (dBi) minus the loss of the site infrastructure connecting the BS
antenna connector with the antenna (dB) for the applied frequency. The
antenna nominal gain is only applicable within a certain frequency
range. For *BS type 1-H*, G~Ant~ shall be an assumption on the gain of a
passive antenna system in order to provide a total power emissions level
comparable to the level obtained when a *BS type 1-C* is connected to a
passive antenna. A typical example of a passive antenna gain, as used
for *BS type 1-O*, is 17 dBi.

\- \"n\" is the index number of the co-located antennas illuminating the
same cell. P~EIRPn~ is the P~EIRP~ of the *n*th antenna.

\- \"Cell\" is in this annex used in the sense that it is the limited
geographical area covered by the carrier transmitted from one site.

# F.3 Relationship between EIRP based regulatory requirements and OTA requirements

The regulations set an EIRP limit considering a passive antenna BS.
Although the gain of passive antennas may vary somewhat, the variation
is in the order of a few dBs. The gain variation of a *BS type 1-O* may
be much larger. However, *BS type 1-O* unwanted emissions requirements
are defined as TRP, since TRP impacts co-existence properties.

In order to relate the EIRP values in the specifications to TRP, a fixed
assumption has been made on the gain of a typical passive BS antenna.

Thus, the maximum TRP can be estimated using the following formulas:

TRP limit per antenna: P~TRP,\ antenna~ = P~EIRP~ - G~Ant~

TRP limit per cell or per BS: P~TRP~ =P~TRP,antenna~ + 9 dB

It is noted that the *BS type 1-O* architecture assumes that a BS
subject to OTA requirements will have at least 8 antennas.

In case the TRP requirement is set per polarization, the summation shall
be made per polarization.

\- \"P~EIRP~\" is the effective isotropic radiated power (or radiated
power spectral density) set in the regulation (assuming a passive BS
antenna) in dBm (or dBm/measurement BW).

\- \"G~Ant~\" is the effective antenna gain, the antenna gain (dBi) is a
fixed reference value of 17 dBi. Directivity value should be used in
above equations, however with all antenna losses are assumed zero then
we can use effective antenna gain.

######## Annex G (Normative): Propagation conditions

# G.1 Static propagation condition

The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist
for this propagation model.

# G.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions

The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:

\- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized
by a number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile
can be further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum
delay spanned by the taps.

\- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay
profile and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical
spectrum shape and a maximum Doppler frequency.

\- Different models are used for FR1, FR2(24.25 GHz -- 71 GHz).

## G.2.1 Delay profiles

The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.901 \[16\] TDL models.
The simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps
are only used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay
profiles specified in G.2.1.1, G.2.1.2 and G.2.1.3 can be used as such.

Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.901 \[16\].

Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays.

Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
clause 7.7.3 in TR 38.901 \[16\].

Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is
done simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the
delay resolution.

Step 5: If multiple taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge them
by calculating their linear power sum.

Step 6: If there are more than 12 taps in the quantized model, merge the
taps as follows

\- Find the weakest tap from all taps (both merged and unmerged taps are
considered)

\- If there are two or more taps having the same value and are the
weakest, select the tap with the smallest delay as the weakest tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the first delay tap, merge taps as follows

\- Update the power of the first delay tap as the linear power sum of
the weakest tap and the second delay tap.

\- Remove the second delay tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the last delay tap, merge taps as follows

\- Update the power of the last delay tap as the linear power sum of the
second-to-last tap and the last tap.

\- Remove the second-to-last tap.

\- Otherwise

\- For each side of the weakest tap, identify the neighbour tap that has
the smaller delay difference to the weakest tap.

\- When the delay difference between the weakest tap and the identified
neighbour tap on one side equals the delay difference between the
weakest tap and the identified neighbour tap on the other side.

\- Select the neighbour tap that is weaker in power for merging.

\- Otherwise, select the neighbour tap that has smaller delay difference
for merging.

\- To merge, the power of the merged tap is the linear sum of the power
of the weakest tap and the selected tap.

\- When the selected tap is the first tap, the location of the merged
tap is the location of the first tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- When the selected tap is the last tap, the location of the merged tap
is the location of the last tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is based on the average
delay of the weakest tap and selected tap. If the average delay is on
the sampling grid, the location of the merged tap is the average delay.
Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is rounded towards the
direction of the selected tap (e.g. 10 ns & 20 ns 15 ns, 10 ns & 25 ns
20 ns, if 25 ns had higher or equal power; 15 ns, if 10 ns had higher
power) . The weakest tap and the selected tap are removed.

\- Repeat step 6 until the final number of taps is 12.

Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB -8.8
dB)

Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap merge,
adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the power of
the last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.

Step 9: Re-normalize the highest tap to 0 dB.

Note 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification
steps may differ from the values in tables G.2.1.1-2, G.2.1.1-3,
G.2.1.1-4, G.2.1.2-2, G.2.1.2-3, G.2.1.2-4 and G.2.1.2-5 for the
corresponding model.

Note 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the
linear domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the
linear domain.

### G.2.1.1 Delay profiles for FR1

The delay profiles for FR1 are selected to be representative of low,
medium and high delay spread environment. The resulting model parameters
are specified in table G.2.1.1-1 and the tapped delay line models are
specified in tables G.2.1.1-2 \~ G.2.1.1-4.

## G.2.2 Combinations of channel model parameters

The propagation conditions used for the performance measurements in
multi-path fading environment are indicated as a combination of a
channel model name and a maximum Doppler frequency, i.e.,
TDLA\<DS\>-\<Doppler\>, TDLB\<DS\>-\<Doppler\> or TDLC\<DS\>-\<Doppler\>
where \'\<DS\>\' indicates the desired delay spread and \'\<Doppler\>\'
indicates the maximum Doppler frequency (Hz).

The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are
defined in Table G.2.3.1.2-2, G.2.3.1.2-3 and G.2.3.1.2-4 as below.

The values in Table G.2.3.1.2-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 and 4x4
high correlation cases to insure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4-digit precision. This is done using
the equation:

![](./38104/media/image102.wmf)

Where the value \"a\" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value
is used to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high
correlation case, a=0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case,
a=0.00012.

The same method is used to adjust the 4x4 medium correlation matrix in
Table G.2.3.1.2-3 to insure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4-digit precision with a =0.00012.

NOTE: For completeness, the correlation matrices were defined for high,
medium and low correlation but performance requirements exist only for
low correlation.

### G.2.3.2 Multi-Antenna channel models using cross polarized antennas

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in G.2.3.2 apply to two
cases as presented below:

\- One TX antenna and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized
antennas used at gNB

\- Multiple TX antennas and multiple RX antennas case, with cross
polarized antennas used at both UE and gNB

The cross-polarized antenna elements with +/-45 degrees polarization
slant angles are deployed at gNB. For one TX antenna case, antenna
element with +90 degree polarization slant angle is deployed at UE. For
multiple TX antennas case, cross-polarized antenna elements with +90/0
degrees polarization slant angles are deployed at UE.

For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for
the other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number
of TX or RX antennas.

# G.3 High speed train condition

High speed train conditions are as follows:

\- Scenario 1-NR350 / Scenario 1-NR500: Open space

\- Scenario 3-NR350 / Scenario 3-NR500: Tunnel

\- Scenario 4-BI-NR350, FR2: Open space

The high speed train conditions for the test of the baseband performance
are three non-fading propagation channels. For BS with Rx diversity, the
Doppler shift time variation is the same for each antenna at each time
instant.

Doppler shift for all three scenarios is given by:

![](./38104/media/image136.wmf) (G.3.1)

where ![](./38104/media/image137.wmf) is the Doppler shift and
![](./38104/media/image138.wmf) is the maximum Doppler frequency.

For Sceanrio 1 and Scenario 3, he cosine of angle
![](./38104/media/image139.wmf) is given by:

![](./38104/media/image140.wmf), ![](./38104/media/image141.wmf) (G.3.2)

![](./38104/media/image142.wmf), ![](./38104/media/image143.wmf) (G.3.3)

![](./38104/media/image144.wmf), ![](./38104/media/image145.wmf) (G.3.4)

where ![](./38104/media/image146.wmf) is the initial distance of the
train from BS, and ![](./38104/media/image147.wmf) is BS-Railway track
distance, both in meters; ![](./38104/media/image148.wmf) is the
velocity of the train in m/s, ![](./38104/media/image149.wmf) is time in
seconds.

For Sceanrio 4, the cosine of angle $\theta(t)$ is given by:

$\cos{\theta(t)} = \frac{D_{s} - vt}{\sqrt{D_{\min}^{2} + \left( D_{s} - vt \right)^{2}}},\ \ \ \ 0 < t \leq {(0.5*D}_{s})/v$
(G.3.5)

$\cos{\theta(t)} = - \frac{vt}{\sqrt{D_{\min}^{2} + (vt)^{2}}},\ \ \ {(0.5*D}_{s})/v < t \leq D_{s}/v$
(G.3.6)

$\cos{\theta(t)} = cos\theta\left( t\ mod\left( \frac{D_{s}}{v} \right) \right),\ \ \ \ t > D_{s}/v$
(G.3.7)

where $D_{s}$ is the initial distance of the train from BS, and
$D_{\min}$ is BS-Railway track distance, both in meters; $v$ is the
velocity of the train in m/s; $t$ is time in seconds.

The required input parameters are listed in table G.3-1 and G.3-2. The
resulting time varying Doppler shift is shown in Figure G.3-1, G.3-2,
G.3-3, G.3-4 and G.3-9 for 350km/h scenarios, and in Figure G.3-5,
G.3-6, G.3-7 and G.3-8 for 500km/h scenarios. For 350km/h scenarios, the
Doppler shift was derived such that it corresponds to a velocity of
around 350km/h for band n1 for the 15kHz SCS, for band n77 for the 30kHz
SCS, and for band n257 for the 120kHz SCS. For 500km/h scenarios, the
Doppler shift was derived such that it corresponds to a velocity of
around 500km/h for band n3 for the 15kHz SCS and for band n77 for the
30kHz SCS. However, the same Doppler shift requirement shall be applied
regardless of the frequency of operation of the basestation and thus for
lower frequencies, the supported speed is higher.

Figure G.4-1 illustrates the moving propagation conditions for the test
of the UL timing adjustment performance. The time difference between the
reference timing and the first tap is according Equation (G.4-1). The
timing difference between moving UE and stationary UE is equal to Δτ -
(*T~A~* −31)×16×64*T~c~* for 15kHz SCS, Δτ - (*T~A~* −31)×16×32*T~c~*
for 30kHz SCS and Δτ - (*T~A~* −31)×16×8*T~c~* for 120kHz SCS. The
relative timing among all taps is fixed. The parameters for the moving
propagation conditions are shown in Table G.4-1.
